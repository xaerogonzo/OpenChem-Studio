"""tests/test_bridged_tetrahedral_stereo.py

Stage 22 R22-D regression tests.

R22-D extends the R22-C OPSIN-validation pass to cover bridged/spiro
ring parents at plain-integer locants.  The relaxation in
``_collect_stereo_descriptors`` admits those tetrahedral R/S
descriptors; ``_validate_stereo_via_opsin`` then strips them when
OPSIN cannot anchor the resulting name (Stage 6 R1-I tropane /
morphinan class — OPSIN returns an empty result for the candidate).

Coverage:

* Camphor (``bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one`` parent) — OPSIN parses
  ``(1R,4R)``, descriptors must survive.
* Norbornene-derived stereocenters — same parent class, must survive.
* Tropane-class chiral substituents
  (``8-methyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-yl ...``) — OPSIN rejects
  the candidate name when stereo is present, validator must strip.
* Achiral bridged parents — must NOT spuriously gain a stereo prefix.
