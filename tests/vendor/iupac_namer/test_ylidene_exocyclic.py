Regression tests for Stage 6 R2-H — ylidene exocyclic =C= substituent.

When a retained substituent fragment (e.g. "cyclohexyl", "phenyl") is attached
to the parent via a double bond (bond order 2) rather than a single bond, its
suffix must be "-ylidene" per IUPAC P-29.2, not "-yl".  The retained-name leaf
path bypasses the generic ring numbering and so must apply the bond-order
swap locally.

Root cause #17 in docs/opsin_coverage_taxonomy.md:
    benzylidenecyclohexane  (SMILES C(=C1CCCCC1)c1ccccc1)
    phenylmethylidenecyclohexane  (same SMILES)

Both of these produce a =C= exocyclic pattern.  With benzene chosen as the
parent, the substituent fragment is C=C1CCCCC1 (methylenecyclohexane) with
the =C= pointing toward the parent and the =C1CCCCC1 pointing away.  The
correct substituent name is "(cyclohexylidene)methyl" — where "cyclohexyl"
becomes "cyclohexylidene" because the internal bond to the cyclohexane ring
carbon is double.

Before the fix, our engine emitted "(cyclohexylmethyl)benzene", silently
dropping the exocyclic double bond.  After the fix:
    C(=C1CCCCC1)c1ccccc1  =>  [(cyclohexylidene)methyl]benzene  (round-trips)
