"""Tests for Stage 15 R15-B + R15-C: stereo emission on complex ring parents.

Pre-fix: ``_collect_stereo_descriptors`` (engine.py) had two layers that
together silently dropped stereo descriptors on complex-ring parents:

1.  An early-return guard skipped ALL stereo emission when the parent
    was a non-monocyclic ring system (fused/bridged/spiro/retained), to
    avoid the Stage 6 R1-I regression on tetrahedral stereo at letter-
    suffixed bridgehead locants.

2.  The per-double-bond loop required BOTH bond endpoints to be in the
    parent atom set (``begin in parent_atoms and end in parent_atoms``).
    A bond crossing the parent-substituent boundary (e.g. C2 of a benzo-
    furanone parent ↔ exocyclic methylidene C of a ``=CHPh`` substituent)
    failed this check and was silently dropped.

R15-B narrows both gates for double-bond stereo:

- The early return becomes a per-descriptor flag (``skip_tetrahedral``)
  that only suppresses tetrahedral stereo on complex ring parents.
- Double-bond stereo with one endpoint in the parent and the other in a
  substituent now anchors the descriptor at the parent endpoint's locant.
- A safety gate keeps double-bond stereo on complex ring parents to
  plain-integer locants only — letter-suffixed locants like ``4a`` /
  ``12b`` (junction atoms) still skip emission.

R15-C extends the relaxation to tetrahedral stereo:

- Tetrahedral R/S on FUSED ring parents (not bridged/spiro) at plain-
  integer locants is now emitted.  Closes audit-row regressions for
  chroman C3 (``3-phenylchroman-7-ol``) and tetralin C1
  (``tetralin-1-amine``).
- Bridged von-Baeyer parents (camphor, tropane class) still skip
  tetrahedral stereo — preserves the Stage 6 R1-I -6 regression fix.
