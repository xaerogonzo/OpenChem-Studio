"""Regression tests for ring-embedded heterocation "-ium" suffix (P-73.1).

Stage 9 R9-A: the Stage 8 audit refresh flagged that aromatic 5-ring
heterocycles carrying `[s+]`, `[o+]`, `[p+]` etc. were silently dropping
the charge — e.g. ``c1cs[s+]n1`` (1,2,3-dithiazol-2-ium) rendered as
``'1,2,3-dithiazole'``, a neutral name mismatching the input.

Root cause: three gates in ``iupac_namer/engine.py`` that drive the
"-N-ium" suffix machinery were hard-coded to check ``symbol == "N"``
only:

1. STANDALONE → CATION auto-promotion (net-charge-positive single
   fragments).
2. Leaf retained-name bypass when a charged neutral-stem retained
   entry would otherwise match.
3. ``ring_cation_locants`` collector in the SubstitutivePath.

Fix: introduce ``_RING_CATION_IUM_ELEMENTS`` covering Group 15
pnictogens (N, P, As, Sb, Bi) and Group 16 chalcogens (O, S, Se, Te),
and broaden all three gates.  Carbon cations (``-ylium``) are handled
by a separate classifier and are NOT part of this change.  Assembly
is already element-agnostic (emits ``-{locant}-ium`` based on the
atom's ring locant only) so no changes needed there.

Each probe below is a round-trip test: we name the input SMILES,
hand the emitted name back to OPSIN, and assert the canonicalised
SMILES matches the input's canonical form.  This pins the **semantic**
correctness of the fix, not a brittle exact-name match.
