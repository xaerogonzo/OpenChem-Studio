"""Stage 1 fused-ring naming: ortho-fused two-component systems where the
smaller partner is a 5-ring with a [1,3]-dihetero pattern (dioxolo, dithiolo,
oxathiolo, ...).

These tests verify that:
  1. The new fused-ring naming module produces the expected
     ``[1,3]<prefix>[4,5-<letter>]<base>`` form for cases where no retained
     name applies.
  2. Each generated name round-trips correctly through OPSIN to the same
     canonical SMILES as the input.
  3. Existing retained names (e.g. 1,3-benzodioxole) are still preferred
     over the new systematic form (architectural priority preserved).
