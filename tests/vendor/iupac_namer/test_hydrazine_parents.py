tests/test_hydrazine_parents.py

Unit tests for hydrazine (N-N) as parent hydride and hydrazinyl as substituent form.
Covers: standalone, mono-substituted, di-substituted, fully-substituted,
        hydrazinyl as ring substituent, and non-regression for baseline cases.

These tests verify both Fix 1 (hydrazinyl substituent_form) and Fix 2
(N-N heteroatom_chain parent hydride).
