"""Regression tests for long-chain polyene multiplier rendering.

Stage 8 diagnostic: the audit refresh flagged lycopene (13 conjugated
double bonds) as emitting a malformed suffix ``...30-13aene``.  The
root cause was an out-of-range fallback in
``iupac_namer/perception/chains.py::_multiplier``: the local lookup
table only covered counts 2-10 (di/tri/.../deca) and fell back to
``f"{count}a"`` for larger chains — so 13 double bonds rendered as
``13aene`` instead of ``tridecaene``.

Fix: ``_multiplier`` now delegates to ``data_loader.get_multiplier``,
which has the full table (undeca, dodeca, trideca, tetradeca,
pentadeca, ...).

These tests pin a synthetic "open-chain polyene" form for each count
from 11 to 20 so any regression in the lookup path surfaces immediately.
``name_smiles`` is invoked with a plain ``C=C=C=...`` (cumulated double
bonds) skeleton; the engine's parent picks up the single longest chain
with N double bonds, so the rendered suffix is exactly the multiplier
prefix + ``ene``.
