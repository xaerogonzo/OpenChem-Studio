"""Regression tests for Stage 6 R1-A follow-up retained-ring closures.

Stage 6 R1-A (commit 3383700) installed the kekulé-disambiguation rewrite
table for retained ring names but deferred four ring families.  This
follow-up closes them by adding curated entries (with verified
``atom_locants``) to ``iupac_namer/data_loader._RING_CURATED_SMILES``:

  * **biphenylene** — IUPAC P-25.1.1 retained name; D2h tricyclic with a
    central cyclobutadiene fusing two benzene rings.  Was previously
    completely missing (engine emitted "No valid naming plan found").
  * **5H-phenarsazine** — saturated NH/AsH tautomer of phenarsazine.
    Previously emitted as the long von Baeyer name
    ``9-aza-2-arsatricyclo[8.4.0.0^{3,8}]tetradeca-...``; now emitted as
    the IUPAC-preferred ``5H-phenarsazine``.  (The imine canonical
    ``c1ccc2c(c1)N=c1ccccc1=[As]2`` for ``phenarsazine`` already round-
    trips at the parent level via the existing retained_lookup
    atom_locants entry; substituent-side Dewar-flip mirror cases at
    positions 3, 4, 6, 7 are deferred — see DEFERRED note below.)
  * **5H-phenoxarsine** — saturated O+AsH form.  Previously emitted as
    ``phenoxarsinin`` (Hantzsch-Widman name OPSIN happens to accept);
    now emitted as the IUPAC-preferred ``5H-phenoxarsine``.

The kekulé-store mechanism (``iupac_namer.ring_naming.kekule_store``) is
already in place from R1-A; these closures use the curated_smiles entry
pathway, which feeds the same atom_locants pipeline used by R1-A's
existing rewrites (e.g. 1H-indene, 3H-perimidine).  No new shape; no
guard relaxation; no atoms dropped — this is purely a data addition that
the existing engine layers consume.

Three families covered → four pinned canonicals (biphenylene parent,
5H-phenarsazine parent, 5H-phenoxarsine parent — plus per-position
chloro probes).  The fourth family from the original R1-A deferred set
(corrin) was already pinned at the parent level in commit
``cc1a0f4``-era work; no kekulé tautomer alternative needs adding.

DEFERRED — Dewar mirror flip on phenarsazine (imine canonical):
  Substituents at positions 3, 4, 6, 7 of the imine ``phenarsazine``
  (canonical ``c1ccc2c(c1)N=c1ccccc1=[As]2``) produce two distinct
  RDKit canonicals depending on which side of the C2v mirror axis the
  substituent sits — RDKit cannot canonicalize across the
  =N-...-As=  ↔  N=...=As  Dewar flip.  Eight substituted forms split
  into two non-overlapping canonical buckets (1,2,8,9 → one; 3,4,6,7 →
  the mirror-flip), and the parent canonical is shared by both buckets
  so the kekulé_store rewrite key cannot distinguish them.  Architecture
  fix would require a Dewar-aware substituent-to-locant remap (out of
  scope for this follow-up).  The primary parent name and 1,2,8,9
  positions DO round-trip via the existing retained_lookup atom_locants
  entry; only the mirror-side positions show the mismatch.
