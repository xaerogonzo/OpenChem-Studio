"""Tests for Stage 22 R22-C: letter-suffix tetrahedral R/S on fused parents.

R15-C had restricted tetrahedral stereo on fused ring parents to plain-
integer locants only (a follow-up extension to letter-suffix junction
locants like ``4a`` / ``6a`` / ``12a`` was reverted in R15-C-followup
because FDA-0605 — the galantamine derivative whose parent is
``[1]benzofuro[3a,3,2-ef][2]benzazepine`` — became OPSIN-unparseable
when the bridgehead ``12aS`` descriptor was emitted).

R22-C reopens the gate AND adds a post-assembly OPSIN-validation pass
in :func:`iupac_namer.engine.name_smiles`: the engine emits letter-
suffix R/S descriptors liberally, and when OPSIN cannot anchor one of
them the validator strips them and re-assembles.  This closes the ergot
/ lysergol family (parent ``indolo[4,3-fg]quinoline`` cleanly tolerates
``(6aR,9S)``) without regressing FDA-0605.

The 3 ergot rows are pinned via OPSIN round-trip; the FDA-0605 control
is pinned to the (6R)-only emit.
