"""Regression tests for the 2,3-dihydro-1-benzofuran (coumaran) atom_locants
augmentation in ``iupac_namer/ring_naming/retained_lookup.py``.

Background (Stage 7 follow-up):
The curated entry for ``c1ccc2c(c1)CCO2`` (2,3-dihydro-1-benzofuran, aka
coumaran) shipped without ``atom_locants``.  The default sorted-atom-index
numbering misnumbered substituted forms — 4/5/6/7-methyl-coumaran round-
tripped to the wrong locants:

    * Cc1ccc2c(c1)OCC2  was emitted as 4-methyl, should be 6-methyl
    * Cc1cccc2c1OCC2    was emitted as 3-methyl, should be 7-methyl
    * Cc1cccc2c1CCO2    was emitted as 5-methyl, should be 4-methyl

The ``_CURATED_ATOM_LOCANTS_AUGMENT`` table in retained_lookup.py supplies
the missing ring-atom -> IUPAC-locant mapping, mirroring the role of
``_OPSIN_RING_ATOM_LOCANTS`` for OPSIN-data entries.  Atom-locant values
were derived from OPSIN methyl-probing on every numeric position
(2,3,4,5,6,7) with bond-generic SubstructMatch onto the canonical ring
SMILES.

Each tuple in ``_PROBES`` below pins
    (input_smiles, expected_engine_name)
and is round-tripped through OPSIN to confirm canonical-SMILES equivalence.
