# Changelog — vendored `iupac_namer`

Changes made since the pinned upstream commit
`c3eac17ffd110c7c5dd37aaad2955e06cf8c9303`. Upstream is abandoned, so this is
the only history there will be; see `VENDORING.md` for provenance and
`KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` for what is still wrong.

The engine's correctness criterion is the **OPSIN round trip**: a name is
right when parsing it back yields the structure it came from. Since 2026-08-01
that is checked on two independent gates, canonical SMILES and full InChIKey.

## 2026-08-01 — vendoring

* 302 imports re-homed from `iupac_namer.` to `openchem.vendor.iupac_namer.`
  across 33 modules. Purely mechanical.
* `tests/audit/_audit_helpers.py`, which upstream never committed, was
  reconstructed at `tests/vendor/iupac_namer/audit/`. Three test files import
  it; writing it fixed 7 of upstream's 12 failures, which were failing on the
  missing module rather than on their merits.
* State as received: 2,907 passing, 12 failing, one file that would not
  collect. After the helper: 2,940 passing, 5 failing, 16 skipped.

## 2026-08-01 — the remaining 5 test failures were the tests, not the engine

Investigated all five. None was an engine defect; the engine's output is more
correct in every case, so the expectations were corrected and the comments
that had misled them fixed.

* **Cyclophosphazene lambda numbering (2 tests).** Engine emits
  `1,2,2,4,5,6-hexamethyl-2lambda5-1,3,5,2,4,6-triazatriphosphinine`; the
  tests pinned `4lambda5` with methyls at 1,2,3,4,4,6. Both round-trip, so
  only the lowest-locant rule separates them. The ring name pins N to 1,3,5
  and P to 2,4,6, leaving six numberings; the engine's wins **both** the
  lambda-locant criterion (2 < 4) and P-14.4's lowest-locants-to-prefixes
  (`1,2,2,4,5,6` < `1,2,3,4,4,6`), so it is right however that hierarchy is
  read. The expectation came from an illustrative example in
  `try_hantzsch_widman`'s comment block that the code never produced — with
  the lambda tiebreaker disabled it yields `6lambda5`, not `4lambda5`.
* **Polyacylium surface names (3 tests).** Tests pinned
  `malonylium`/`succinylium`/`glutarylium`. Those retained names are kept for
  general nomenclature only and the systematic name is the PIN
  (P-65.1.1.2.2 / P-66.6.3); `engine.py`'s `_RETAINED_ACID_STEM_TABLE` records
  that decision with citations, and the acid path deliberately emits
  `propanedioic acid`, never `malonic acid`. The expectations were therefore
  unreachable by construction. Four dead keys removed from
  `_RETAINED_DIACID_TO_DIACYLIUM`; `oxalic acid` stays because its retained
  name IS the PIN.

## 2026-08-01 — instrumentation and a second correctness gate

* **`diagnostics.py`** (new). Off unless `OPENCHEM_NAMER_DEBUG` is set or a
  `capture()` scope is open. Records every point where a charged molecule is
  handed back to the plan-search neutralizer, attributed to the gate that let
  it go (`unclaimed` / `ambiguous` / `partial_claim` / `charge_sum_mismatch` /
  `render_failed`), plus per-renderer attempted/succeeded/failed counters.
  The counters live in their own module so `charge_perception` keeps its
  documented "no module-level mutable state" invariant.

  The attribution immediately corrected the working model: instrumenting only
  the render site would have missed most of the inventory, because the benzyl
  cation, phenyl anion and guanidinium never reach a renderer at all.
* **Full InChIKey as a second round-trip gate** in `benchmarks/naming`.
  Compare the FULL key, never the 14-character skeleton block: guanidinium and
  neutral guanidine share skeleton `ZRALSGWEFCBTJO` and differ only in the
  final protonation character. It found on arrival that two of the four
  standing benchmark failures are tautomers, not wrong molecules.
* Benchmark scoring gained a per-molecule HTML report and a run-to-run delta
  that lists regressions first, so a swap — one molecule fixed, another
  broken, headline score unmoved — cannot hide.

## 2026-08-01 — severity-A fixes (wrong molecule)

Fourteen inputs that named the wrong compound. All are pinned in
`tests/test_namer_known_defects.py`, which runs in the **default** suite.

* **Ring polyacylium** (D-001, 7 cases). `_diacid_name_to_polyacylium` knew
  only `oxalic acid` and the chain `<parent>dioic acid`; ring parents arrive
  as `<ring>-<locants>-dicarboxylic acid`, so it returned `None` and every
  ring-based polyacylium named as its neutral aldehyde — the phthaloyl
  dication as `1,2-bis(oxomethyl)benzene`, i.e. phthalaldehyde. Added the
  `carboxylic acid` -> `carbonylium` rule (P-65.3.1).
* **`-ylium` / `-ide` locant** (D-005, 9 cases). `_render_simple_carbon`
  hardcoded `locant = 1`, true only for a terminal charge — which is all four
  compounds it was written against had, so the round-trip never caught it.
  `C[CH+]C` was named `propan-1-ylium` (it is propan-2-ylium) and
  `[CH2+]C1CCCCC1` was named `methylcyclohexan-1-ylium`, which moves the
  charge onto the ring. The renderer now asks the engine to name the skeleton
  as a **substituent anchored at the charged atom**: the free valence is the
  anchor that forces the parent to contain that atom and number it lowest,
  which is exactly what `-ylium`/`-ide` requires (P-31.1.4). Reuses the
  engine's own parent selection rather than reimplementing it.
* **Charge next to unsaturation** (D-002 family, 7 cases).
  `_classify_simple_carbon_charge` required every atom non-aromatic and every
  bond single, so benzyl/allyl/vinyl/propargyl/diphenylmethyl cations and
  anions were unclaimed — and unclaimed means neutralized, not left alone.
  Gate is now "all-carbon skeleton, charged atom not aromatic". Two guards
  were added after measurement showed the relaxed gate stealing the retained
  ring cations (`phenylium` had started coming out as `benzene-1-ylium`): the
  charge may not sit in an unsaturated ring, and a Kekule-written ring cation
  is not flagged aromatic by RDKit so the ring-saturation test is the one that
  matters.

Benchmark unchanged at 120/124 across all of the above, stereochemistry 11/11.

## 2026-08-01 — ring N-oxides in substituent position

D-024, the last open severity-A defect.  `[CH2+]c1cc[n+]([O-])cc1` came out as
`(pyridin-4-yl)methan-1-ylium 1-oxide`, which OPSIN cannot parse.

Additive nomenclature produces a TWO-WORD name, and a substituent has to end
in `-yl` so its parent can attach to it -- there is nothing to attach to the
end of the word "oxide".  The additive check in `engine.py` fired regardless
of output form, so it wrapped a cation core.

The fix is one condition: **the additive path declines in SUBSTITUENT output
form.**  The substitutive path already knew how to render the ring --
`1-(oxido)pyridin-1-ium-4-yl` -- it was simply never reached, because additive
claimed the molecule first.  Standalone output is untouched, so
`pyridine 1-oxide`, `pyridine-4-carboxylate 1-oxide`,
`trimethylamine oxide` and `dimethyl sulfoxide` all keep the additive form
that is correct for them.

With that in place the simple-carbon classifier no longer needs to refuse a
ring-embedded charge-separated group, so the guard added for D-018 is gone
again.  The obstacle was never the charge; it was the two-word name.

Two cheaper routes were tried first and both were wrong, which is why they are
recorded in `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`: a curated ring entry keyed on the N-oxide
ring is dead data (the additive path strips the oxide before ring lookup), and
composing the name from parts means reimplementing substituent assembly for
one molecular shape.

Benchmark unchanged at 163/165 -- D-024 is not in the corpus, so this one is
verified by the defect table rather than by the score.

**The severity-A open list is now empty.**

## 2026-08-01 — poly-N-substituted guanidinium

D-025.  Guanidinium with more than one N-substituent was declined by the
classifier and fell through to the neutralizer, so `CNC(NC)=[NH2+]` came out
as `1-imino-N,N'-dimethylmethane-1,1-diamine` with the charge gone.

Guanidine numbers the charged (imino) nitrogen **2** and the two amino
nitrogens 1 and 3.  Lowest locants go to the more heavily substituted amino
nitrogen, which is what makes `CNC(=[NH2+])N(C)C` `1,1,3-trimethylguanidinium`
rather than `1,3,3-`.  Substituents are carved out, named as prefixes by the
engine, grouped by name, and emitted with multiplicity and alphabetical order:

  CNC(NC)=[NH2+]      -> 1,3-dimethylguanidinium
  CN(C)C(N)=[NH2+]    -> 1,1-dimethylguanidinium
  CNC(=[NH2+])N(C)C   -> 1,1,3-trimethylguanidinium
  CNC(N)=[NH+]C       -> 1,2-dimethylguanidinium
  CCNC(=[NH2+])NC     -> 1-ethyl-3-methylguanidinium

A lone substituent keeps the locant-free form (`methylguanidinium`): 1 and 3
are equivalent when only one is substituted, so it is unambiguous.

D-024 -- a ring N-oxide in substituent position -- remains open and is now
characterised in `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`, including the two cheaper fixes that
were tried and rejected.

## 2026-08-01 — the last five open severity-A defects

Cleared the open list. Each had a different cause, and two of them turned out
to be one cause shared.

* **D-013, D-018 — the all-carbon gate.** `_classify_simple_carbon_charge`
  required EVERY atom to be carbon, far stronger than its own justification:
  the heteroatom motifs it exists to protect (acylium, iminium, amidinium) all
  have the heteroatom bonded directly to the charged atom, so checking the
  charged atom's own NEIGHBOURS suffices. The stronger form left any charge on
  a hetero-containing skeleton unclaimed, and unclaimed means neutralized --
  `[CH2+]c1ccncc1` came out as `4-methylpyridine`. Relaxing it also fixed the
  furyl, methoxy and hydroxy carbocations for free.

  Charge-separated groups elsewhere (nitro, azido) are now claimed rather than
  refused: they carry no net charge and are ordinary prefixes, but the coverage
  gate needs them accounted for. They must be OUTSIDE a ring -- a ring-embedded
  one makes the parent an additive two-word name (`pyridine 1-oxide`) that
  nothing can be spliced onto, which is D-024.

  Formylium is curated rather than classified: `_classify_acylium` demands no
  hydrogen on the `[C+]` and a single-bonded R, and the R=H member has one H
  and no R. Widening that pattern for a one-member family buys nothing.

* **D-015 — azolides.** Worse than dropping the charge: the plan search MOVED
  it, naming pyrrolide `1H-pyrrol-2-ide` with the charge on a ring carbon. The
  ring-anion classifier now covers nitrogen. The trap was the neutralization
  probe -- an aromatic ring N needs its hydrogen stated EXPLICITLY or the ring
  will not kekulize, and the failure presented as "not an aromatic ring anion",
  silently skipping the whole family. Imidazolide, tetrazolide and pyrazolide
  came along with it, moving from Hantzsch-Widman stems to retained PINs.

* **D-019 — diazoalkane ylides.** Net-neutral but carrying both a carbanion
  and a diazonium; `_classify_diazonium` claimed only the two nitrogens, so the
  coverage gate refused the molecule. Named as the carbanion's own `-ide` name
  plus `yldiazonium`, which delegates parent selection and numbering to the
  renderer that already gets them right. The attachment locant has to be
  restated -- `propan-2-idyl` lets OPSIN default the attachment to C1, giving a
  different molecule -- hence `propan-2-id-2-yldiazonium`.

* **D-020 — N-substituted guanidinium.** One substituent is named as a prefix
  on `guanidinium`. Two or more are declined rather than half-named (D-025),
  because the locants would have to be assigned across the guanidine skeleton.

Benchmark 162/165 -> **163/165**, diazomethane `no_prediction -> equivalent`.
Zero wrong structures, zero refusals, zero unparsable names: the only two
failures left are tautomers, and those are not errors.

## 2026-08-01 — the pyrazole stem in the partially-saturated path

D-023, severity B: right molecule, wrong ring stem. With no curated entry for
the partially-saturated 1,2-diazole ring, naming fell through to
Hantzsch-Widman, which spells it `1,2-diazole` — so 2-pyrazoline came out as
`4,5-dihydro-1H-1,2-diazole`. `pyrazole` is a retained ring name and the PIN
(P-25.2.1).

Only pyrazole was affected, which is worth knowing before assuming the hydro
path is broken generally. Imidazole and pyrrole already have curated
partially-saturated entries (`4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazole`,
`2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrole`), and oxazole and thiazole get away without one
because their Hantzsch-Widman names — `1,3-oxazole`, `1,3-thiazole` — ARE the
preferred forms. Pyrazole is the only 5-ring in that set whose HW name differs
from its PIN, so it was the only one the gap could bite. Aromatic pyrazole was
never affected.

Two curated ring entries added beside the imidazoline one they mirror, with
`atom_locants` derived by OPSIN chloro-probing exactly as that entry documents.
For `4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole` locant 2 cannot be probed — it is the `=N-`, and
chlorinating it saturates the ring, so `2-chloro-…` resolves to pyrazolidine
instead; it is the one remaining atom and the one remaining locant.

This propagates through the whole pyrazolone family fixed in D-022: the
benchmark row is now `…-5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-4-yl…`, and the edaravone
core is `3-methyl-1-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-5-one`.

Knock-on, kept deliberately rather than worked around: a curated entry for the
2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrazole skeleton outranks the pre-composed `4-pyrazolone`
stem, so that ring now takes the systematic `4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-4-one`.
That is the same treatment `5-pyrazolone` received in D-022 for being
semi-systematic rather than a PIN, so both pyrazolone stems now behave
consistently. Round-trip verified on both gates.

Benchmark unchanged at 162/165 — as expected for a severity-B fix, since both
forms denote the same molecule.

## 2026-08-01 — pre-composed retained rings in substituent position

D-022, severity A, and the last wrong structure in the corpus.

`5-pyrazolone` encodes C4's saturation only by convention. Put the ring in
substituent position and the name becomes `…-5-pyrazolon-4-yl`, which removes
the very hydrogen that made C4 sp3 — OPSIN then re-reads the whole ring as its
aromatic tautomer, a different species. Every senior characteristic group that
pushes the ring into substituent position hit it: amide, carboxylic acid,
nitrile. Only the benchmark's one pyrazolone row made it visible.

The retained lookup cannot detect this on its own, and that is worth recording
for whoever meets the shape again: `try_retained_name(ring_system, mol)`
receives the CARVED fragment, which is byte-identical to the standalone
molecule, and neither it nor the plan scorer in `strategy.py` is told the
output form. There is no structural signal to test.

What made a contained fix possible is that `5-pyrazolone` is semi-systematic
rather than a PIN — the PIN is the systematic `2,4-dihydro-3H-pyrazol-3-one`
form — so the engine's existing `_DATAFILE_PIN_INELIGIBLE_NAMES` gate is the
right home for it, next to tetralin/indan/chroman/isochroman. Declining the
stem outright sidesteps the missing context: the systematic path states the
saturation explicitly and is correct in BOTH positions.

That gate turned out to be wired into only one of the two branches that read
`_smiles_to_record`. The oxo fallback — the branch that matches rings keeping
an exocyclic =O, which is exactly where the pyrazolone family arrives — never
consulted it. Both branches now do.

Benchmark 161/165 -> **162/165**, and the wrong_structure count reaches
**zero**: every row the engine still answers, it answers with a name that
denotes the molecule it was given. The three remaining failures are two
tautomers and one refusal.

Knock-on worth stating: the systematic path spells the ring `1,2-diazole`
(Hantzsch-Widman) where `pyrazole` is the retained PIN. That is severity B,
pre-existing, and independent of this change — the hydro path already emitted
it — but routing the pyrazolone family through that path makes it far more
visible. Recorded in `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`.

## 2026-08-01 — azide

D-016, severity A. `[N-]=[N+]=[N-]` named as `diiminoazanium`, which denotes
`N=[N+]=N` — a **cation**. The same one name came out for the azide anion
(q=−1) *and* for its conjugate acid HN3 (q=0), so a single confident answer
covered three different species and matched none of them.

No classifier claimed the N3 chain, so the plan search invented something.
Azide belongs with the other retained pseudohalides in the curated inorganic
table — cyanide, thiocyanate, cyanate, isocyanate, isothiocyanate are all
there — and simply was not. Two entries added: `azide` and, for the conjugate
acid, `hydrogen azide` (the PIN; OPSIN also accepts the retained "hydrazoic
acid").

The salt path inherited the fix for free: `[Na+].[N-]=[N+]=[N-]` was
`sodium diiminoazanium` and is now `sodium azide`. Organic azides were never
affected — `azidoethane` and `azidobenzene` go through the `azido` substituent
prefix, a separate path that was always correct.

Benchmark 160/165 -> **161/165**; polycharged 11/12 -> 12/12, which makes all
four charged-species categories perfect. One wrong structure now remains in
the whole 165-molecule corpus.

## 2026-08-01 — aromatic ring carbanions and guanidinium

Two more severity-A defects, both surfaced by the extended corpus.

* **D-003, aromatic ring carbanion.** `c1ccc[c-]c1` named as `cyclohexane`,
  losing the charge AND the aromaticity. `_classify_simple_carbon_charge`
  refuses an aromatic charged atom on purpose — a ring carbanion needs the
  ring parent's numbering, not a chain's — and nothing else claimed it.
  `_classify_aromatic_ring_anion` now does, emitting the plain `"ide"` hint so
  the existing renderer composes the name from the ring parent and the
  engine's own substituent numbering: `benzen-1-ide`, and it generalises to
  `naphthalen-1-ide`, `naphthalen-2-ide`, `pyridin-2-ide`, `pyridin-3-ide`.

  The gate took three attempts, and the two rejected ones are worth recording
  because they look sufficient. A **radical** test misses `[cH-]1cccc1`, which
  is closed-shell. "No hydrogen on the charged carbon" misses
  `Clc1ccc[c-]1Cl`, where a chlorine occupies the position rather than a
  proton having left it — and that arrives here as a lone fragment of a
  ferrocene salt, so it is not hypothetical. The gate that works is the one
  that matches the chemistry: **neutralize the site and check the ring is
  still aromatic.** Benzenide is a sigma carbanion, so putting the hydrogen
  back gives benzene; cyclopentadienide is a delocalised pi anion, so putting
  it back gives cyclopenta-1,3-diene, which is not aromatic and belongs to the
  retained-name path.

* **D-004, guanidinium.** `[NH2+]=C(N)N` named as
  `iminomethane-1,1-diamine`. `_classify_amidinium` requires the third
  substituent on the central carbon to be a CARBON, so guanidinium — whose
  third substituent is another amino nitrogen — fell through to the
  neutralizer. `guanidine` is a retained functional parent (P-66.4.1.2.1.2)
  and `guanidinium` its retained cation (P-73.1), so the name is emitted
  directly. Scope is the unsubstituted parent; `methylguanidinium` is recorded
  as D-020 rather than half-claimed, because with the refusal guard in place a
  classifier that claims what it cannot render raises instead of mis-naming.

`_splice_alkane_suffix` now elides a trailing `e` from any parent, not only
`-ane`: `ylium` and `ide` are vowel-initial, so `benzene` + `ide` is
`benzen-1-ide`. OPSIN accepts the unelided form too, but the elided one is the
PIN.

Benchmark 158/165 -> **160/165**; carbanion 7/8 -> 8/8, onium_ion 8/9 -> 9/9.

## 2026-08-01 — the neutralizer fall-through now refuses, selectively

Decided on measurement rather than principle. Over the benchmark corpus plus
the 69-probe sweep (193 molecules), `render_failed` occurred 0 times and
`partial_claim` once, while `unclaimed` occurred 35 times and was almost
always a molecule some other path names correctly.

So the first two raise and the third does not. A classifier that engaged with
a molecule and then could not finish can only produce a name for a different
molecule, because the coverage gate has already established which charges are
claimed. `unclaimed`, by contrast, is this module declining business that
belongs to the retained-ring path and friends — pyridinium, sulfonium,
betaine, nitrobenzene, phenylium.

Visible effect: `name_smiles("[CH2-][N+]#N")` raises instead of returning
`(azanylidyne)(methyl)azanium`, which was the methyldiazonium **cation** —
an invented hydrogen and a charge that is not in the input. On the benchmark
diazomethane moved `wrong_structure -> no_prediction`, so the score is
unchanged; the difference is that one of those two is honest.

## 2026-08-01 — indicated hydrogen survives the ring table (D-026)

The ring-table entry for `c1cn[nH]n1` was labelled `1H-1,2,3-triazole`, which
is the other tautomer — OPSIN parses `1H-` to `c1c[nH]nn1` — and the 1H form
had no entry at all. Both inputs therefore came back named as the 1H
structure, discarding the indicated hydrogen the caller supplied. A plain data
mislabel, not an algorithm defect: the 1,2,4-triazole and tetrazole entries
sitting beside it already distinguished their tautomers correctly.

Probing all 13 tautomer-sensitive azoles in the tables found no second case.
The purine family still normalises to `9H-purine` on purpose (see
`KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`); that is the only remaining place where an input
tautomer is not preserved.

This also corrects a claim made earlier in this branch. The two standing
benchmark failures were described as "tautomers, not errors" — true of
metformin, false of the triazole, where the engine really was substituting a
different structure. The mistake came from reading a matching InChIKey as
proof of correctness when InChI cannot distinguish mobile hydrogens at all.

## 2026-08-01 — benchmark corpus extended to 181

The last three fixes (D-024 ring N-oxide substituents, D-025 poly-N-substituted
guanidinium, D-026 tautomers) all had to be verified against the defect table
rather than the score, because the corpus contained nothing from those
families. Added 16 rows — `n_oxide` (6), `guanidinium` (5), `tautomer` (5) —
so those paths are now measured on every run.

Re-running the **as-vendored** engine against the extended corpus shows how
much each category actually discriminates, which is not uniform:
`guanidinium` 0/5 and `n_oxide` 4/6 then, both 100% now — those rows catch
their defects outright. `tautomer` scores 5/5 *both* times, because the
as-vendored engine emitted the bare name `1,2,3-triazole` for the 1H input
and OPSIN resolves a bare name to 1H, so it round-tripped by luck. D-026 is
caught by the pre-existing `heterocycle` row (the 2H form), not by the new
category; the new rows guard the 1,2,4-triazole and tetrazole pairs that were
already correct. Worth stating plainly: adding rows to a corpus does not by
itself mean the corpus can see the defect they were added for.
