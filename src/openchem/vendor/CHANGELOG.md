# Changelog — vendored `iupac_namer`

Changes made since the pinned upstream commit
`c3eac17ffd110c7c5dd37aaad2955e06cf8c9303`. Upstream is abandoned, so this is
the only history there will be; see `VENDORING.md` for provenance and
`KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` for what is still wrong.

The engine's correctness criterion is the **OPSIN round trip**: a name is
right when parsing it back yields the structure it came from. Since 2026-08-01
that is checked on two independent gates, canonical SMILES and full InChIKey.

## 2026-08-01 — vendoring

* 302 imports re-homed from `iupac_namer.` to `openchem.vendor.iupac_namer.`
  across 33 modules. Purely mechanical.
* `tests/audit/_audit_helpers.py`, which upstream never committed, was
  reconstructed at `tests/vendor/iupac_namer/audit/`. Three test files import
  it; writing it fixed 7 of upstream's 12 failures, which were failing on the
  missing module rather than on their merits.
* State as received: 2,907 passing, 12 failing, one file that would not
  collect. After the helper: 2,940 passing, 5 failing, 16 skipped.

## 2026-08-01 — the remaining 5 test failures were the tests, not the engine

Investigated all five. None was an engine defect; the engine's output is more
correct in every case, so the expectations were corrected and the comments
that had misled them fixed.

* **Cyclophosphazene lambda numbering (2 tests).** Engine emits
  `1,2,2,4,5,6-hexamethyl-2lambda5-1,3,5,2,4,6-triazatriphosphinine`; the
  tests pinned `4lambda5` with methyls at 1,2,3,4,4,6. Both round-trip, so
  only the lowest-locant rule separates them. The ring name pins N to 1,3,5
  and P to 2,4,6, leaving six numberings; the engine's wins **both** the
  lambda-locant criterion (2 < 4) and P-14.4's lowest-locants-to-prefixes
  (`1,2,2,4,5,6` < `1,2,3,4,4,6`), so it is right however that hierarchy is
  read. The expectation came from an illustrative example in
  `try_hantzsch_widman`'s comment block that the code never produced — with
  the lambda tiebreaker disabled it yields `6lambda5`, not `4lambda5`.
* **Polyacylium surface names (3 tests).** Tests pinned
  `malonylium`/`succinylium`/`glutarylium`. Those retained names are kept for
  general nomenclature only and the systematic name is the PIN
  (P-65.1.1.2.2 / P-66.6.3); `engine.py`'s `_RETAINED_ACID_STEM_TABLE` records
  that decision with citations, and the acid path deliberately emits
  `propanedioic acid`, never `malonic acid`. The expectations were therefore
  unreachable by construction. Four dead keys removed from
  `_RETAINED_DIACID_TO_DIACYLIUM`; `oxalic acid` stays because its retained
  name IS the PIN.

## 2026-08-01 — instrumentation and a second correctness gate

* **`diagnostics.py`** (new). Off unless `OPENCHEM_NAMER_DEBUG` is set or a
  `capture()` scope is open. Records every point where a charged molecule is
  handed back to the plan-search neutralizer, attributed to the gate that let
  it go (`unclaimed` / `ambiguous` / `partial_claim` / `charge_sum_mismatch` /
  `render_failed`), plus per-renderer attempted/succeeded/failed counters.
  The counters live in their own module so `charge_perception` keeps its
  documented "no module-level mutable state" invariant.

  The attribution immediately corrected the working model: instrumenting only
  the render site would have missed most of the inventory, because the benzyl
  cation, phenyl anion and guanidinium never reach a renderer at all.
* **Full InChIKey as a second round-trip gate** in `benchmarks/naming`.
  Compare the FULL key, never the 14-character skeleton block: guanidinium and
  neutral guanidine share skeleton `ZRALSGWEFCBTJO` and differ only in the
  final protonation character. It found on arrival that two of the four
  standing benchmark failures are tautomers, not wrong molecules.
* Benchmark scoring gained a per-molecule HTML report and a run-to-run delta
  that lists regressions first, so a swap — one molecule fixed, another
  broken, headline score unmoved — cannot hide.

## 2026-08-01 — severity-A fixes (wrong molecule)

Fourteen inputs that named the wrong compound. All are pinned in
`tests/test_namer_known_defects.py`, which runs in the **default** suite.

* **Ring polyacylium** (D-001, 7 cases). `_diacid_name_to_polyacylium` knew
  only `oxalic acid` and the chain `<parent>dioic acid`; ring parents arrive
  as `<ring>-<locants>-dicarboxylic acid`, so it returned `None` and every
  ring-based polyacylium named as its neutral aldehyde — the phthaloyl
  dication as `1,2-bis(oxomethyl)benzene`, i.e. phthalaldehyde. Added the
  `carboxylic acid` -> `carbonylium` rule (P-65.3.1).
* **`-ylium` / `-ide` locant** (D-005, 9 cases). `_render_simple_carbon`
  hardcoded `locant = 1`, true only for a terminal charge — which is all four
  compounds it was written against had, so the round-trip never caught it.
  `C[CH+]C` was named `propan-1-ylium` (it is propan-2-ylium) and
  `[CH2+]C1CCCCC1` was named `methylcyclohexan-1-ylium`, which moves the
  charge onto the ring. The renderer now asks the engine to name the skeleton
  as a **substituent anchored at the charged atom**: the free valence is the
  anchor that forces the parent to contain that atom and number it lowest,
  which is exactly what `-ylium`/`-ide` requires (P-31.1.4). Reuses the
  engine's own parent selection rather than reimplementing it.
* **Charge next to unsaturation** (D-002 family, 7 cases).
  `_classify_simple_carbon_charge` required every atom non-aromatic and every
  bond single, so benzyl/allyl/vinyl/propargyl/diphenylmethyl cations and
  anions were unclaimed — and unclaimed means neutralized, not left alone.
  Gate is now "all-carbon skeleton, charged atom not aromatic". Two guards
  were added after measurement showed the relaxed gate stealing the retained
  ring cations (`phenylium` had started coming out as `benzene-1-ylium`): the
  charge may not sit in an unsaturated ring, and a Kekule-written ring cation
  is not flagged aromatic by RDKit so the ring-saturation test is the one that
  matters.

Benchmark unchanged at 120/124 across all of the above, stereochemistry 11/11.

## 2026-08-01 — azide

D-016, severity A. `[N-]=[N+]=[N-]` named as `diiminoazanium`, which denotes
`N=[N+]=N` — a **cation**. The same one name came out for the azide anion
(q=−1) *and* for its conjugate acid HN3 (q=0), so a single confident answer
covered three different species and matched none of them.

No classifier claimed the N3 chain, so the plan search invented something.
Azide belongs with the other retained pseudohalides in the curated inorganic
table — cyanide, thiocyanate, cyanate, isocyanate, isothiocyanate are all
there — and simply was not. Two entries added: `azide` and, for the conjugate
acid, `hydrogen azide` (the PIN; OPSIN also accepts the retained "hydrazoic
acid").

The salt path inherited the fix for free: `[Na+].[N-]=[N+]=[N-]` was
`sodium diiminoazanium` and is now `sodium azide`. Organic azides were never
affected — `azidoethane` and `azidobenzene` go through the `azido` substituent
prefix, a separate path that was always correct.

Benchmark 160/165 -> **161/165**; polycharged 11/12 -> 12/12, which makes all
four charged-species categories perfect. One wrong structure now remains in
the whole 165-molecule corpus.

## 2026-08-01 — aromatic ring carbanions and guanidinium

Two more severity-A defects, both surfaced by the extended corpus.

* **D-003, aromatic ring carbanion.** `c1ccc[c-]c1` named as `cyclohexane`,
  losing the charge AND the aromaticity. `_classify_simple_carbon_charge`
  refuses an aromatic charged atom on purpose — a ring carbanion needs the
  ring parent's numbering, not a chain's — and nothing else claimed it.
  `_classify_aromatic_ring_anion` now does, emitting the plain `"ide"` hint so
  the existing renderer composes the name from the ring parent and the
  engine's own substituent numbering: `benzen-1-ide`, and it generalises to
  `naphthalen-1-ide`, `naphthalen-2-ide`, `pyridin-2-ide`, `pyridin-3-ide`.

  The gate took three attempts, and the two rejected ones are worth recording
  because they look sufficient. A **radical** test misses `[cH-]1cccc1`, which
  is closed-shell. "No hydrogen on the charged carbon" misses
  `Clc1ccc[c-]1Cl`, where a chlorine occupies the position rather than a
  proton having left it — and that arrives here as a lone fragment of a
  ferrocene salt, so it is not hypothetical. The gate that works is the one
  that matches the chemistry: **neutralize the site and check the ring is
  still aromatic.** Benzenide is a sigma carbanion, so putting the hydrogen
  back gives benzene; cyclopentadienide is a delocalised pi anion, so putting
  it back gives cyclopenta-1,3-diene, which is not aromatic and belongs to the
  retained-name path.

* **D-004, guanidinium.** `[NH2+]=C(N)N` named as
  `iminomethane-1,1-diamine`. `_classify_amidinium` requires the third
  substituent on the central carbon to be a CARBON, so guanidinium — whose
  third substituent is another amino nitrogen — fell through to the
  neutralizer. `guanidine` is a retained functional parent (P-66.4.1.2.1.2)
  and `guanidinium` its retained cation (P-73.1), so the name is emitted
  directly. Scope is the unsubstituted parent; `methylguanidinium` is recorded
  as D-020 rather than half-claimed, because with the refusal guard in place a
  classifier that claims what it cannot render raises instead of mis-naming.

`_splice_alkane_suffix` now elides a trailing `e` from any parent, not only
`-ane`: `ylium` and `ide` are vowel-initial, so `benzene` + `ide` is
`benzen-1-ide`. OPSIN accepts the unelided form too, but the elided one is the
PIN.

Benchmark 158/165 -> **160/165**; carbanion 7/8 -> 8/8, onium_ion 8/9 -> 9/9.

## 2026-08-01 — the neutralizer fall-through now refuses, selectively

Decided on measurement rather than principle. Over the benchmark corpus plus
the 69-probe sweep (193 molecules), `render_failed` occurred 0 times and
`partial_claim` once, while `unclaimed` occurred 35 times and was almost
always a molecule some other path names correctly.

So the first two raise and the third does not. A classifier that engaged with
a molecule and then could not finish can only produce a name for a different
molecule, because the coverage gate has already established which charges are
claimed. `unclaimed`, by contrast, is this module declining business that
belongs to the retained-ring path and friends — pyridinium, sulfonium,
betaine, nitrobenzene, phenylium.

Visible effect: `name_smiles("[CH2-][N+]#N")` raises instead of returning
`(azanylidyne)(methyl)azanium`, which was the methyldiazonium **cation** —
an invented hydrogen and a charge that is not in the input. On the benchmark
diazomethane moved `wrong_structure -> no_prediction`, so the score is
unchanged; the difference is that one of those two is honest.
