FR-5.2 / FR-5.3 (P-25.3.3) canonical peripheral numbering for ortho-fused
ring systems.

This is an ADDITIVE module.  Its single public entry point,
``compute_peripheral_numbering``, takes an ortho-fused ring system (a tree of
rings joined by shared two-atom edges, no spiro/bridge) and returns the IUPAC
canonical per-atom locant assignment as a :class:`Numbering`, with ring-fusion
(junction) atoms carrying the ``Na`` letter suffix (``3a``, ``7a`` …) exactly
as the published fusion names use.

Why this exists
---------------
The fusion-name builders in :mod:`fused.py` (``_try_mono_hetero_fused`` and the
[1,3]-dihetero Stage-2B multi-ring path) emit a correct *name string* but, for
the mono-hetero path, leave ``numbering_options`` empty.  Downstream,
``numbering.compute_ring_numberings`` then falls back to the generic
``_compute_fused_numberings`` peripheral walk, which numbers every atom
``1..N`` sequentially (no ``Na`` junction suffixes) and scores by a different
heuristic.  The result is substituent locants that are inconsistent with — and
often *outside the range of* — the emitted fusion name (e.g.
``9-chlorofuro[2,3-b]pyridine``, where position 9 does not exist).

``compute_peripheral_numbering`` produces the genuine FR-5.3 numbering so the
mono-hetero path can attach it as ``numbering_options`` and substituent locants
land where OPSIN expects them.

The numbering rule (P-25.3.3, the relevant subset for ortho-fused bicyclics
and small ortho-fused tricyclics):

  1.  Atoms are numbered around the periphery in one direction.  Interior /
      ring-fusion atoms (shared by two rings) receive the immediately preceding
      peripheral number plus a letter (``a``, ``b`` …).
  2.  The starting atom and direction are chosen so that, in priority order:
        (a)  heteroatoms as a set get the lowest locants;
        (b)  carbon atoms common to two rings (fusion carbons) get the lowest
             locants;
        (c)  heteroatoms get low locants in element-seniority order
             (O > S > Se > Te > N > P > …);
      Numbering must begin at an atom next to a ring-fusion atom (the
      "uppermost, farthest-right" atom in the FR-5.2 preferred orientation;
      for a perimeter that is a single cycle, this is equivalent to: position 1
      is a non-fusion atom immediately following a fusion atom in the chosen
      direction).

For an ortho-fused bicyclic the whole molecule's perimeter is a single cycle
(the two fusion atoms are the only branch points), which makes (1) a plain
cyclic walk with the two fusion atoms suffixed.  This module handles that case
exactly and generalises to a cata-fused (tree, no interior atom shared by 3
rings) chain of rings.

It deliberately returns ``None`` for systems it cannot number unambiguously
(peri-fused systems with an interior atom shared by 3 rings, bridged/spiro
inputs) so the caller falls back to its existing behaviour — never emitting a
wrong numbering.

          locants over the largest ring's atoms is lowest.  This resolves the
          mirror ambiguity on near-symmetric skeletons (e.g.
          ``pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazine``) where rules 1-3 tie: FR-5.2 places the

          This is the FR-5.2 2D-orientation tie-break for the near-symmetric

          locant.  Criterion 5 fires ONLY when 1-4 tie, so it is strictly
          additive and never disturbs an already-resolved numbering.  (For the
          furo/thieno members the two mirrors are related by a true molecular
          automorphism — there is no indicated hydrogen and either numbering
          yields identical substituent locants, so this criterion correctly
