# OpenChem Studio — notes for Claude

## Working in a git worktree — do this before anything else

A fresh worktree needs two things set up, and **both fail silently rather
than loudly**, which is why they are the first thing in this file.

```bash
uv sync --extra ai --extra network --extra openbabel
"D:/Claude Co worker/Token Save/tokensave.exe" init
```

**The venv.** A worktree has no `.venv`. `uv run` will happily create an
empty one and then report `No module named pytest`, which reads like a
broken checkout rather than a missing sync.

**The tokensave index — the dangerous one.** The MCP server is registered
globally as `tokensave.exe serve` with no `--root`, and finds its project
by searching *upward* for a `.tokensave/` directory. A worktree created
under `.claude/worktrees/` sits inside the main repo folder and has none
of its own, so the search walks up and serves **the main checkout's
code** — a different branch, without the files you just wrote. Measured
2026-08-04: `tokensave_search` for a class written minutes earlier
returned `[]`.

Every call does carry a `worktree_mismatch` warning. **That warning is not
cosmetic; it means the answers are about different code.** Never work past it.

`init` costs about 2 seconds (343 files, ~8000 nodes) and leaves
`git status` clean. Three things that cost real time when they were not
known:

- **`init` refuses to rebuild an existing index.** It prints a "use
  `tokensave sync`" hint and exits 0, so a stale index looks like a
  successful re-index. Use `sync --force` to actually rebuild.
- **Initialising mid-session does NOT rebind the MCP tools.** The server
  resolved its root when it started, so `tokensave_*` calls keep hitting
  the old index. Until the session restarts, query through the CLI
  instead: `tokensave.exe tool health --path src/openchem`,
  `tokensave.exe tool search SomeClass`.
- **`tokensave branch` does not solve this.** It tracks branches within
  one checkout and syncs from that checkout's files, so it cannot see
  another directory's working tree.

The binary is not on PATH; call it by full path.

## Running the tests

```bash
uv run --no-sync python -u -m pytest -q > /tmp/suite.log 2>&1; tail -5 /tmp/suite.log
```

A clean run is **~2 minutes**, ending at `1858 passed, 2 skipped`. Writing to a
file rather than a pipe is worth doing because it lets you watch progress
while it runs.

The suite also needs the optional extras installed, or ~40 tests fail on
missing imports and it looks like something is badly broken when nothing is:

```bash
uv sync --extra ai --extra network --extra openbabel
```

(Not `--all-extras`: that pulls in `docking`, whose `vina` wheel builds from
source and needs Boost. The reference environment does not have it.)

### The suite used to hang — fixed, kept here as history

This is no longer something to work around. It is recorded because the cause
took three attempts to identify and the failure mode was invisible.

**`QtWebEngineProcess.exe` instances accumulated and were never torn down.**
Every `QWebEngineView` a test constructs spawns Chromium helper processes, and
nothing disposed of them between tests. A hung run was caught with **91 alive**;
a measured baseline reached **116**, plateauing near 88, with the Python
process at **14 seconds of CPU** while wall clock passed 40 minutes — blocked,
not working. They pile up until something (handles, memory, a port) gives out,
always around the webview-heavy tests at roughly 30%.

They ARE reaped when pytest exits, so a post-mortem finds zero and looks
healthy. **The count only means anything sampled DURING a run.**

The fix is the autouse `dispose_web_engine_views` fixture in
`tests/conftest.py` — read its docstring before changing anything there, since
two plausible-looking implementations of it crash. Measured across two full
runs after the fix: peak **6** processes, mostly 0–1, against 116 before.

**Three wrong explanations were believed before the right one** — recorded so
a fourth does not get invented:

1. A bad shell wait-loop (`until grep -q "passed|failed"`, which never matched
   because `-q` buffers). Wrong, and accepting it cost a second 40-minute hang
   the same day.
2. The `pytest.exe` console-script shim under `uv run` spawning an extra
   nested process. Plausible, written into this file as near-fact, and also
   wrong — the module form hung the very next run. The shim was correlation.
3. While fixing it: that tearing pages down mid-load caused the teardown
   crash, so `view.stop()` was the cure. Removing `stop()` did not reproduce
   the crash in 8 runs. The actual cause was
   `sendPostedEvents(None, DeferredDelete)` draining every pending deferred
   delete in the process, including ones other tests had queued on
   already-collected objects. It is now flushed per view.

If a run ever stalls again, sample before assuming it is slow:

```bash
powershell "(Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter \"Name='QtWebEngineProcess.exe'\" | Measure-Object).Count"
```

### A test that builds a panel must destroy it before the next one runs

Same family as the webview leak above, different object, and it fails much
louder. A test that constructs an unparented widget and then calls
`QApplication.processEvents()` -- which any test of an event-driven panel has
to, since `EventBus.publish` is a *queued* Qt signal and nothing has been
delivered when `waitForDone()` returns -- can crash with a **Windows access
violation inside `processEvents`**. The widget from an *earlier* test was
collected by Python at some arbitrary later moment, and this
`processEvents()` drains the `DeferredDelete` posted against it.

Measured on `tests/test_batch_panel.py`: **3 of 3 full runs of the file
crashed**, while running only some subsets of it passed -- because whether it
fires depends on when the collector happened to run. That "sometimes"
is exactly what makes it read as flakiness rather than as a bug in the test.

The fix is a fixture that destroys each widget deterministically and flushes
**that widget's** deferred delete:

```python
widget.setParent(None)
widget.deleteLater()
QCoreApplication.sendPostedEvents(widget, QEvent.Type.DeferredDelete)
```

Per widget, never `sendPostedEvents(None, DeferredDelete)` -- the global form
drains every pending deferred delete in the process, including ones other
test files left queued, which is the same double-free the webview fixture
already documents.

### The suite must not touch the machine's real settings

`Settings` wraps `QSettings`, which on Windows is the real registry key a
shipped install uses. The autouse `isolated_settings` fixture redirects it to
an INI file under `tmp_path`; `tests/test_settings_isolation.py` fails if that
regresses.

Worth knowing because the previous version of that fixture **looked** correct
and half-worked. It called `QSettings.setDefaultFormat(IniFormat)` and gave
each test a unique org/app name — but `setDefaultFormat` does not affect the
`QSettings(organization, application)` constructor in practice, whatever the
docs say:

```python
QSettings.setDefaultFormat(QSettings.Format.IniFormat)
QSettings.defaultFormat()          # Format.IniFormat
QSettings("Org", "App").format()   # Format.NativeFormat  <- still the registry
```

So the real `OpenChemStudio` key stayed clean (the unique name did that much)
while every run deposited **84 junk keys** under `HKCU\Software`, one per
test, named after the test, permanent. Nothing in the suite output showed it.
Building the QSettings from an explicit file path avoids the format question
entirely.

If you touch that fixture, verify by counting, not by reading:

```bash
powershell "(Get-ChildItem 'HKCU:\Software' | Where-Object PSChildName -like 'OpenChemStudio-pytest-*' | Measure-Object).Count"
```

### `repaint()` does not paint a widget that was never shown

A `paintEvent` test that constructs a widget, resizes it and calls
`repaint()` proves nothing. Measured on a counting subclass:

    repaint() on a never-shown widget    0 paintEvent calls
    update() + processEvents             0
    grab()                               1
    repaint() AFTER show()               1

So `widget.grab()` (or showing it first) is the only way to exercise the
painter. Four such tests existed and were green without ever running the
code they named -- including one called `test_highlighting_survives_a_repaint`,
in which no repaint occurred.

**Use `conftest.painted()` / `conftest.ink()`**, which render into a
`QImage` and force the paint.

ASSERTING THAT SOMETHING WAS DRAWN IS HARDER THAN IT LOOKS, and two
plausible checks were tried and killed by mutation testing -- blanking a
widget's peak-drawing loop and seeing which tests noticed:

1. *"Some pixel is non-transparent."* Useless. Every one of these widgets
   fills an opaque background before its first mark, so alpha is set
   across all 30,000 sampled pixels even for an EMPTY spectrum.
2. *"More ink than the same widget with no data."* Still passes a blanked
   painter. Different data changes the axis range, so the tick labels
   alone move the count.

What works: **hold the axes fixed and vary only the content** -- two
spectra sharing their extreme shifts, differing by one peak in the
middle. Identical ticks and labels, so the ink difference can only be the
peak. That took the number of tests catching a blanked painter from 1
to 6.

`ink()` counts pixels differing from the modal (background) colour, not
transparent ones, for reason 1 above.

Tests that assert on child-widget structure rather than drawing -- e.g.
`test_structure_grid_widget.py` counting cells in a layout -- are not
affected and do not need any of this.

### The formerly-flaky webview test

`tests/test_mol3d_viewer_backend.py::test_apply_visualization_sets_atom_colors`
used to fail intermittently on `QWebEngineView` readiness (sometimes a sibling
failed instead — the tell that the test was not what was wrong). It was the
leak above, caught where starting one more Chromium process was slow rather
than impossible.

It failed on the pre-fix baseline run and has passed **5 consecutive full runs**
since. If it flakes again, that is a genuinely new bug, not this one.

### The vendored nomenclature engine's own suite

`tests/vendor/` holds ~3,200 tests belonging to the vendored IUPAC namer. They
are **excluded from the default run** (`norecursedirs` in `pyproject.toml`)
because they take ~10 minutes against the main suite's 3, and they cover that
engine's internals rather than our integration with it.

Run them whenever you change anything under `src/openchem/vendor/`:

```bash
export PATH="/d/Random Programs/OpenChemStudio_Data/jre/jdk-21.0.12+8-jre/bin:$PATH"
uv run --no-sync python -u -m pytest tests/vendor -q > /tmp/vendor.log 2>&1; tail -4 /tmp/vendor.log
```

Expect `3193 passed, 16 skipped`.

**Java must be on PATH** for these, and for any test that touches OPSIN. The
app injects its managed Temurin per-subprocess (`naming_providers._java_on_path`),
but py2opsin shells out to a bare `java` and pytest does not inherit that.
Without it you get a bare `FileNotFoundError` naming neither Java nor OPSIN.

## The naming benchmark

`benchmarks/naming/` is the regression check on naming quality — 181 molecules,
scored by OPSIN round-trip rather than string equality. It is the arbiter for
"is this naming engine better", and it has twice overturned a conclusion
reached without it.

Generate fresh predictions, then score them:

```bash
uv run --no-sync python - <<'PY'
import json
from pathlib import Path
from openchem.vendor.iupac_namer import name_smiles
rows = json.loads(Path("benchmarks/naming/corpus.json").read_text(encoding="utf-8"))
preds = []
for r in rows:
    try: preds.append(str(name_smiles(r["smiles"]) or ""))
    except Exception as e: preds.append(f"<ERROR {type(e).__name__}>")
Path("benchmarks/naming/predictions_check.json").write_text(
    json.dumps({"check": {"predictions": preds}}, indent=1), encoding="utf-8")
PY
uv run --no-sync python benchmarks/naming/score.py benchmarks/naming/predictions_check.json
```

Current: **181/181** (82 exact, 98 equivalent, 1 tautomer — metformin, which
counts as a success since the `tautomer` outcome class was added). If a
change under `src/openchem/vendor/` drops this, that
outranks any number of narrow tests it fixed.

`score.py` takes exactly one predictions file. The committed
`predictions_full.json` and `predictions_deterministic.json` were recorded
against the older 124-molecule corpus and will now be **refused** by the
length guard rather than silently mis-scored — that guard is deliberate, not a
bug. They are kept as the record of what the ML alternatives scored at the
time; compare them only against the corpus revision they were made for.

## Verification standard

This project's convention, established across many sessions: **claims are
measured, not asserted.** Before shipping a formula, a threshold, a parser
regex or a model, verify it against a primary source or a real run and record
what was checked. Several things were deliberately NOT shipped because they
could not be validated (Miller polarizability, HLB, TSEI) — that is a normal
outcome here, not a failure.

Comments explain **why**, especially where something is non-obvious or was got
wrong once. A comment restating the code is noise.
