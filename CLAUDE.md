# OpenChem Studio — notes for Claude

## Working in a git worktree — do this before anything else

A fresh worktree needs two things set up, and **both fail silently rather
than loudly**, which is why they are the first thing in this file.

```bash
uv sync --extra ai --extra network --extra openbabel
"D:/Claude Co worker/Token Save/tokensave.exe" init
```

**The venv.** A worktree has no `.venv`. `uv run` will happily create an
empty one and then report `No module named pytest`, which reads like a
broken checkout rather than a missing sync.

**The tokensave index — the dangerous one.** The MCP server is registered
globally as `tokensave.exe serve` with no `--root`, and finds its project
by searching *upward* for a `.tokensave/` directory. A worktree created
under `.claude/worktrees/` sits inside the main repo folder and has none
of its own, so the search walks up and serves **the main checkout's
code** — a different branch, without the files you just wrote. Measured
2026-08-04: `tokensave_search` for a class written minutes earlier
returned `[]`.

Every call does carry a `worktree_mismatch` warning. **That warning is not
cosmetic; it means the answers are about different code.** Never work past it.

`init` costs about 2 seconds (343 files, ~8000 nodes) and leaves
`git status` clean. Three things that cost real time when they were not
known:

- **`init` refuses to rebuild an existing index.** It prints a "use
  `tokensave sync`" hint and exits 0, so a stale index looks like a
  successful re-index. Use `sync --force` to actually rebuild.
- **Initialising mid-session does NOT rebind the MCP tools.** The server
  resolved its root when it started, so `tokensave_*` calls keep hitting
  the old index. Until the session restarts, query through the CLI
  instead: `tokensave.exe tool health --path src/openchem`,
  `tokensave.exe tool search SomeClass`.
- **`tokensave branch` does not solve this.** It tracks branches within
  one checkout and syncs from that checkout's files, so it cannot see
  another directory's working tree.

The binary is not on PATH; call it by full path.

## Running the tests

```bash
uv run --no-sync python -u -m pytest -q > /tmp/suite.log 2>&1; tail -5 /tmp/suite.log
```

Writing to a file rather than a pipe is worth doing because it lets you watch
progress while it runs.

A clean run is **~4.5 minutes**, ending at `2695 passed, 2 skipped,
1 deselected` (measured 2026-08-06 with the comparison and LED work applied,
bytecode cleared). **That figure is from the DESELECTED form below, not the
command above** -- run it bare and the same tree reports one FAILURE, from
the network test explained next.

**One test fails against the network, not against the code.**
`test_pubchem_name_round_trips_back_through_opsin` returns `HTTP 400` from
NCBI and does so on trees predating the work that was running when it was
first seen -- confirmed by stashing. Deselect it when you need a clean signal:

```bash
uv run --no-sync python -u -m pytest -q --deselect tests/test_naming_providers.py::test_pubchem_name_round_trips_back_through_opsin
```

Take the count on a **clean tree**. The main checkout often carries
work-in-progress tests, and a figure measured there is inflated -- which has
already produced one wrong edit to this file.

The suite also needs the optional extras installed, or ~40 tests fail on
missing imports and it looks like something is badly broken when nothing is:

```bash
uv sync --extra ai --extra network --extra openbabel
```

(Not `--all-extras`: that pulls in `docking`, whose `vina` wheel builds from
source and needs Boost. The reference environment does not have it.)

### The suite used to hang — fixed, kept here as history

This is no longer something to work around. It is recorded because the cause
took three attempts to identify and the failure mode was invisible.

**`QtWebEngineProcess.exe` instances accumulated and were never torn down.**
Every `QWebEngineView` a test constructs spawns Chromium helper processes, and
nothing disposed of them between tests. A hung run was caught with **91 alive**;
a measured baseline reached **116**, plateauing near 88, with the Python
process at **14 seconds of CPU** while wall clock passed 40 minutes — blocked,
not working. They pile up until something (handles, memory, a port) gives out,
always around the webview-heavy tests at roughly 30%.

They ARE reaped when pytest exits, so a post-mortem finds zero and looks
healthy. **The count only means anything sampled DURING a run.**

The fix is the autouse `dispose_web_engine_views` fixture in
`tests/conftest.py` — read its docstring before changing anything there, since
two plausible-looking implementations of it crash. Measured across two full
runs after the fix: peak **6** processes, mostly 0–1, against 116 before.

**Three wrong explanations were believed before the right one** — recorded so
a fourth does not get invented:

1. A bad shell wait-loop (`until grep -q "passed|failed"`, which never matched
   because `-q` buffers). Wrong, and accepting it cost a second 40-minute hang
   the same day.
2. The `pytest.exe` console-script shim under `uv run` spawning an extra
   nested process. Plausible, written into this file as near-fact, and also
   wrong — the module form hung the very next run. The shim was correlation.
3. While fixing it: that tearing pages down mid-load caused the teardown
   crash, so `view.stop()` was the cure. Removing `stop()` did not reproduce
   the crash in 8 runs. The actual cause was
   `sendPostedEvents(None, DeferredDelete)` draining every pending deferred
   delete in the process, including ones other tests had queued on
   already-collected objects. It is now flushed per view.

If a run ever stalls again, sample before assuming it is slow:

```bash
powershell "(Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter \"Name='QtWebEngineProcess.exe'\" | Measure-Object).Count"
```

### A test that builds a panel must destroy it before the next one runs

Same family as the webview leak above, different object, and it fails much
louder. A test that constructs an unparented widget and walks away leaves it
with no owner, so Python destroys it at whatever arbitrary later moment the
collector happens to run -- inside an unrelated test, from within Qt's own
event dispatch. The result is a **Windows access violation**, and it surfaces
in whichever test happens to be pumping events at the time (any test of an
event-driven panel must, since `EventBus.publish` is a *queued* Qt signal and
nothing has been delivered when `waitForDone()` returns).

Measured on `tests/test_batch_panel.py`: **3 of 3 full runs of the file
crashed**, while running only some subsets of it passed -- because whether it
fires depends on when the collector happened to run. That "sometimes"
is exactly what makes it read as flakiness rather than as a bug in the test.

The fix is to destroy each widget deterministically and flush **that
widget's** deferred delete:

```python
widget.setParent(None)
widget.deleteLater()
QCoreApplication.sendPostedEvents(widget, QEvent.Type.DeferredDelete)
```

Per widget, never `sendPostedEvents(None, DeferredDelete)` -- the global form
drains every pending deferred delete in the process, including ones other
test files left queued, which is the same double-free the webview fixture
already documents.

**Do this per file. There is no global version of it, and the attempt to
build one is recorded below as a warning.** The autouse
`flush_deferred_deletes` in `tests/conftest.py` handles only the
`deleteLater()` half -- it stops a backlog accumulating, and does NOT
destroy widgets a test walks away from.
`tests/test_qt_object_disposal.py` fails if it regresses.

#### How the ketcher crash was found, and the two things that were wrong about it

Recorded because the version of this section written before it was solved
named the wrong mechanism, and reasoning from that mechanism produced a fix
that measurably did not work.

The symptom: `test_ketcher_editor_backend.py` died with an access violation
at ~30% of a full run, on 3 runs and then not on the next 6, with CI green
throughout. **Do not trust green runs here** -- the corrected fix below was
verified against a deterministic reproduction, not against a streak.

What was wrong in the old account:

1. *"`processEvents()` drains the `DeferredDelete`."* It does not. Measured
   against this Qt build, a `DeferredDelete` posted at event-loop level 0 is
   delivered only when an actual event loop at that level returns, and
   `QApplication.processEvents()` never delivers one, however many times it
   is called. A pytest run never enters such a loop, so **every**
   `deleteLater()` in the suite sits in the process-wide queue until
   something spins a NESTED event loop -- which drains the entire backlog at
   once. QtWebEngine spins one internally while a page loads. That is the
   whole reason the victim is always a webview test: it is not that its
   `processEvents` pump is dangerous, it is that Chromium is the only thing
   in the suite that lights the fuse.
2. *"The widget's Python wrapper was already collected."* Not for the
   deleteLater'd object itself -- PySide keeps that wrapper alive until the
   event is delivered, so it is still weak-referenceable at session end,
   which is what made a census possible at all.

**Instrumentation found it in one run where bisection could not.** Wrapping
`QObject.deleteLater` to record its receiver weakly, then reporting which
receivers were still valid at each test boundary, named the offenders
exactly: 18 undelivered deletes, of which the 9 `IrViewWidget`s from
`test_ir_view_widget.py` (five files earlier) were the ones live while the
ketcher tests ran. Wrapping widget constructors the same way found the
second, larger half: **112 top-level widgets abandoned by 20 files**.

**Forcing the drain turns the heisenbug into a 12-second reproduction.** Run
one nested `QEventLoop` before each ketcher test and the crash is
deterministic:

```python
loop = QEventLoop(); QTimer.singleShot(0, loop.quit); loop.exec()
```

Measured with that lever, on `test_ir_view_widget.py` + the four files
between + `test_ketcher_editor_backend.py`:

| tree | result |
| --- | --- |
| before the fix | crash 5 / 5 |
| ketcher file alone (nothing queued) | pass |
| deferred deletes flushed only | crash 2 / 2, via `test_jobs_panel.py` |
| both fixtures | pass 8 / 8 |

That middle row looked like the whole story, and it was not.

#### THE WIDGET-DISPOSAL FIXTURE WAS REVERTED. Do not rebuild it blind.

`dispose_app_widgets` tracked every top-level widget of one of this app's
classes and destroyed each at teardown, per object. Against the base it was
developed on (`a85463f`) every number said it worked: the table above, plus
the leaked-widget census 112 -> 0 and 11 of 11 plain full runs green.

**It crashed the suite outright on master**, at `2dff778`, once the
help-window work had added many more MainWindow-with-viewer tests. Measured
by an interleaved A/B with a byte-identical file set, neutering the fixture
in place rather than deleting its test file:

| arm | full runs |
| --- | --- |
| both fixtures active | **access violation 8 / 8** |
| `dispose_app_widgets` neutered, flush still on | complete 8 / 8 |
| `flush_deferred_deletes` neutered, widgets still on | access violation 3 / 3 |

So it is that one fixture, on its own. The crash sites were
`test_main_window_docking_visualization.py` and
`test_ketcher_editor_backend.py` -- the MainWindow-plus-webview tests that
pump events, neither at fault. Re-ordering it to finalise after
`dispose_web_engine_views` did NOT help (still 5 of 5), so "a live view was
taken down as a child" is not the explanation, and why destroying an
abandoned widget synchronously at teardown faults here is **still unknown**.

**The original ketcher crash was open when this was written; it is now
solved -- skip to "SOLVED. The census named it" below before acting on
anything in this subsection.** Two further things
that were measured and do not fit together yet, for whoever picks this up:
master at `a093912` crashed 3 of 3 in a clean worktree with none of these
fixtures, while master at `2dff778` is green 8 of 8 in the main checkout
with none of them. Same suite, opposite results -- so before trusting ANY
result here, pin down the checkout and the commit, and never compare a run
in one against a run in the other.

Method note, learned the hard way: an early "before" measurement was taken
in a checkout that was being edited by hand at the time, so the two arms
were different trees and the comparison was worthless. Check `git status`
and file mtimes before believing an A/B.

#### A `lambda` that captures `self` in a `connect()` leaks the widget forever

Found while chasing the above, and it is a separate bug with a separate
fix. **PySide6 holds a connected plain callable STRONGLY and a QObject's
bound method weakly.** So this roots its widget for the life of the
process -- past refcounting AND past the cyclic collector, which cannot
see through the internal map the callable is kept in:

```python
button.clicked.connect(lambda _checked=False, d=definition: self._open(d))
```

Measured on a three-button minimal case: the self-capturing lambda leaks,
the same widget with `connect(self._go)` is freed by refcounting alone,
and a lambda capturing only plain data is also fine. It is `self` in the
closure that does it, not the lambda.

`PropertyPanel` was the worst of it -- one such connection per registered
calculator, 22 on a default registry -- so every panel ever built stayed
in memory for the session. Fixed, with the payload travelling on the
button as a Qt property and a bound method reading it back through
`sender()`. Same fix in `PeriodicTableDialog` (118 cells) and
`ExternalToolsDialog`.

`tests/test_qt_object_disposal.py` guards all of it, and deliberately
asserts the leak itself as well: if a future PySide6 stops leaking here,
that test fails and the workarounds can go.

#### The root of the cycles: `EventBus` now holds bound methods weakly

`EventBus.subscribe` used to store the handler in a plain list. A bound
method holds its object, so the bus owned every panel that ever subscribed
and the panel owned the bus -- a cycle nothing could break by reference
counting, leaving the whole graph to the cyclic collector.

Bound methods are held with `weakref.WeakMethod` now; everything else is
still held strongly, and that asymmetry is the load-bearing part. A lambda
usually has no other reference, so held weakly it would be collected the
instant `subscribe` returned and the subscription would silently never
fire -- worse than a leak, because nothing looks wrong. Measured when the
change was made: production code subscribes 38 bound methods and ZERO
lambdas, while the tests subscribe 74 lambdas.

Measured effect, per panel:

| | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `JobsPanel` | refcounting | refcounting |
| `DockingPanel` | needed the cyclic collector | **refcounting** |
| `PropertyPanel` | leaked outright | **refcounting** |

**It does NOT replace the teardown `gc.collect()`, and the numbers say so
plainly.** With weak handlers and no collect, late C++ destructions went
UP -- 138 before, 177 after -- because more objects are now destructible
at all rather than leaked. With both, 8, against 2352 destroyed inside
their own test. Keep both.

It also moved MainWindow, without fixing it: with weak handlers AND the
menu lambdas removed, the first window is destroyed cleanly and the
SECOND construction segfaults, 5/5. So destroying a MainWindow leaves
something process-global in a state the next one trips over. That is the
next thread to pull; the section below still applies until it is pulled.

#### What makes MainWindow destruction fault: the undo stack

Bisected against the real window, by disabling one piece at a time:

| window | destroyed |
| --- | --- |
| as built | **segfault 5/5** |
| `_new_molecule` suppressed (nothing ever pushed) | clean 3/3 |
| `_undo_stack.clear()` before dropping | clean 5/5 |
| `close()` alone, before `closeEvent` cleared the stack | **segfault** |

So commands sitting on the stack are what makes destruction fatal, and
clearing it first is what makes destruction safe. `closeEvent` now clears
it, which is why that line is there.

**The mechanism is NOT understood, and nothing here should pretend
otherwise.** A synthetic `QUndoCommand` on a `QUndoStack` destroys fine, so
does the real `AddMoleculeCommand` in a minimal harness, and so does a
hand-built `QMainWindow` carrying every panel, all three web views, custom
dock title bars, a status-bar widget, scroll areas, menus and a plugin
manager -- 3/3 each. It takes the whole real window. The commands are
necessary but not sufficient.

Ruled out along the way, each measured 3-5 times: `QWebEngineView`,
`MoleculeEditorWidget`, `MoleculeViewer3DWidget`, `MolStarViewerBackend`,
all three viewers together in a `QTabWidget`, `DockTitleBar`,
`CheckerStatusIndicator`, `QScrollArea` + `tabifyDockWidget`, menus,
`PluginManager`, and `_restore_window_state`.

##### The full fix IS shipped, once the collect was moved

The first attempt looked like a disaster and was reverted: menu lambdas
removed + this clear + the seven `test_main_window_*` files closing their
windows made the suite green 2/2 while late C++ destructions went from 8
to **1190**. The open question was "after `window.close()`, what still
references the window?"

**Nothing in the application does.** Listing the referrers of a window
still alive at teardown found only pytest: `SubRequest`, `TopRequest`,
`_pytest.python.Function`, and the fixture-name cache. Pytest holds every
fixture value for the whole item protocol, so a `gc.collect()` running in
`pytest_runtest_teardown` CANNOT collect a fixture-provided window -- and
the conftest hook had no `trylast`, so it ran before fixtures were even
finalised.

    collect in pytest_runtest_teardown, unordered   1190 late
    collect in pytest_runtest_teardown, trylast      135 late
    collect in pytest_runtest_logfinish                0 late

Zero, with 3587 destroyed inside their own test, the suite green 3/3, the
forced-drain reproduction 0/10, and the run slightly FASTER than before.

The trap worth remembering: a test that builds its window as a plain local
cannot tell the right hook from the wrong one, because the local is
released when the function returns either way. The guard in
`tests/test_qt_object_disposal.py` takes its window from a FIXTURE for
exactly that reason -- the first version of it did not, and the mutation
survived.

#### MainWindow's menu lambdas ARE fixed now (an earlier note said not to)

They were reverted once, with the note "the leak is load-bearing", because
removing them made the window collectable and destroying a MainWindow
crashed. Both halves of that are now solved and the fix is in:

- `closeEvent` empties the undo stack, which is what made destruction
  safe (see the section above it);
- the collect runs after the item protocol, so windows are collected at
  the right moment (see below).

Menu actions carry their payload on the `QAction` via `setData` and connect
bound methods that read it back through `sender()`. Two facts about Qt that
this depends on, measured rather than assumed, because the file previously
asserted the opposite of the first:

    menu.addAction(label, callable)     calls it with NO arguments,
                                        whatever its signature
    action.triggered.connect(callable)  passes `checked`

So a handler reached through `addAction` keeps its own defaults --
`_duplicate_molecule(molecule=None)` really does receive None -- and only
`toggled`/`triggered` connections have to take the bool.

#### The root of the cycles: `EventBus` now holds bound methods weakly

`EventBus.subscribe` used to store the handler in a plain list. A bound
method holds its object, so the bus owned every panel that ever subscribed
and the panel owned the bus -- a cycle nothing could break by reference
counting, leaving the whole graph to the cyclic collector.

Bound methods are held with `weakref.WeakMethod` now; everything else is
still held strongly, and that asymmetry is the load-bearing part. A lambda
usually has no other reference, so held weakly it would be collected the
instant `subscribe` returned and the subscription would silently never
fire -- worse than a leak, because nothing looks wrong. Measured when the
change was made: production code subscribes 38 bound methods and ZERO
lambdas, while the tests subscribe 74 lambdas.

Measured effect, per panel:

| | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `JobsPanel` | refcounting | refcounting |
| `DockingPanel` | needed the cyclic collector | **refcounting** |
| `PropertyPanel` | leaked outright | **refcounting** |

**It does NOT replace the teardown `gc.collect()`, and the numbers say so
plainly.** With weak handlers and no collect, late C++ destructions went
UP -- 138 before, 177 after -- because more objects are now destructible
at all rather than leaked. With both, 8, against 2352 destroyed inside
their own test. Keep both.

It also moved MainWindow, without fixing it: with weak handlers AND the
menu lambdas removed, the first window is destroyed cleanly and the
SECOND construction segfaults, 5/5. So destroying a MainWindow leaves
something process-global in a state the next one trips over. That is the
next thread to pull; the section below still applies until it is pulled.

#### What makes MainWindow destruction fault: the undo stack

Bisected against the real window, by disabling one piece at a time:

| window | destroyed |
| --- | --- |
| as built | **segfault 5/5** |
| `_new_molecule` suppressed (nothing ever pushed) | clean 3/3 |
| `_undo_stack.clear()` before dropping | clean 5/5 |
| `close()` alone, before `closeEvent` cleared the stack | **segfault** |

So commands sitting on the stack are what makes destruction fatal, and
clearing it first is what makes destruction safe. `closeEvent` now clears
it, which is why that line is there.

**The mechanism is NOT understood, and nothing here should pretend
otherwise.** A synthetic `QUndoCommand` on a `QUndoStack` destroys fine, so
does the real `AddMoleculeCommand` in a minimal harness, and so does a
hand-built `QMainWindow` carrying every panel, all three web views, custom
dock title bars, a status-bar widget, scroll areas, menus and a plugin
manager -- 3/3 each. It takes the whole real window. The commands are
necessary but not sufficient.

Ruled out along the way, each measured 3-5 times: `QWebEngineView`,
`MoleculeEditorWidget`, `MoleculeViewer3DWidget`, `MolStarViewerBackend`,
all three viewers together in a `QTabWidget`, `DockTitleBar`,
`CheckerStatusIndicator`, `QScrollArea` + `tabifyDockWidget`, menus,
`PluginManager`, and `_restore_window_state`.

##### The full fix was built, measured, and NOT shipped

Menu lambdas removed + `closeEvent` clearing the stack + the seven
`test_main_window_*` files closing their windows: **the suite went green
2/2**, and late C++ destructions went from 8 to **1190**. Closing a window
does not lead to it being destroyed in its own test, and what still holds
it was not identified. Trading a leak for a 150x increase in exactly the
quantity that predicts this crash is not a trade worth making on a green
run alone, so it was reverted. The `closeEvent` clear was kept: it is
correct on its own and costs nothing.

If someone picks this up, the open question is narrow and stated: after
`window.close()` and a `gc.collect()` at teardown, what still references
the window?

#### DO NOT "FIX" MAINWINDOW'S MENU LAMBDAS. THE LEAK IS LOAD-BEARING.

`MainWindow` leaks the same way, through about a dozen
`menu.addAction(label, lambda: self._foo())` calls in `_build_menus`. It
was fixed -- payload on the QAction via `setData`, bound dispatchers
reading `sender()` -- and the fix was reverted, because removing the leak
made the window collectable and **a MainWindow cannot be destroyed
without corrupting the heap**:

| tree | outcome |
| --- | --- |
| lambdas present | window LEAKED, never destroyed, 3/3 |
| lambdas removed | really destroyed -> **segfault 8 / 8** |

In the suite it surfaces as `Windows fatal exception: code 0xc0000374`
(heap corruption) inside the teardown `gc.collect()`.

**This is not a new bug and it was never a lambda bug.** MainWindow has
never been destructible; the leak has always hidden it. That also explains
the two earlier attempts to dispose abandoned MainWindows in the tests,
which crashed 6/6 and 8/8 -- they were not causing a crash, they were
DESTROYING A MAINWINDOW, which is the crash.

Two measurement traps that wasted an hour here, both worth avoiding:

- **A probe that prints "destroyed" after `del` + `gc.collect()` proves
  nothing.** It has to assert with a weakref that the object really died.
  Without that, a leaked window reads as a successful destruction, and a
  bisect across eight commits reported "destructible" everywhere while
  destroying nothing at all.
- **Reverting any ONE piece of the fix appeared to cure the crash.** It
  did not -- it just left one lambda still leaking, so nothing was
  destroyed. Any partial revert looks like a fix, which makes bisecting
  within the change actively misleading.

The individual children are fine: `QWebEngineView`, `MoleculeEditorWidget`,
`MoleculeViewer3DWidget`, `MolStarViewerBackend`, and all three viewers
together in a `QTabWidget`, destroy cleanly 3-5 times each. It is
MainWindow as a whole.

The likely mechanism, not yet confirmed: MainWindow, the service
container, the EventBus and every panel form ONE cycle, so the collector
takes them together in an order nobody controls, and Qt objects are
finalised while other Qt objects still point at them. If that is right,
the real fix is at the root -- `EventBus._handlers` holding bound methods
STRONGLY is what welds the graph into a single cycle, and holding them
weakly would let the pieces die by refcounting in a controlled order.
That is a change to core event semantics and needs its own careful pass.

A deterministic 20-line reproduction exists; rebuild it by constructing a
MainWindow, dropping every reference, calling `gc.collect()`, and
asserting with a weakref that it died.

#### SOLVED. The census named it, and the fix is one line of timing.

Read this before touching anything above: the two sections that follow are
kept as the record of how it was chased, but the cause is now measured and
the fix is in `tests/conftest.py`.

**Census A (undelivered deletes) found nothing** -- 0 outstanding at every
test boundary and at session end. `flush_deferred_deletes` had already
closed that half completely, so every hypothesis built on the delete
backlog was chasing a queue that is empty.

**Census B (widgets alive at session end) measured the wrong population.**
It reported 65 live parentless panels, which looks damning and is
irrelevant: a widget still alive has never been destroyed, so it cannot be
the thing that faults. Those 65 are a LEAK, not a landmine.

**Census C, then D, found it.** Instrumenting `QObject.destroyed` -- the
only event that runs a C++ destructor -- and recording the test that was
running at that instant against the test that built the widget:

    destroyed inside their own test : 2003
    destroyed in a LATER test       : 138   <- the landmine, measured

138 from seven files, 104 of them `test_quantum_chemistry_panel.py`. (Do
NOT use a weakref callback for this, as census C did: it counts Python
wrappers, over-reports by an order of magnitude -- 1406 -- because a
wrapper collected after Qt already destroyed the C++ object is harmless.)

**Why they outlive their test.** `EventBus.subscribe` stores the BOUND
METHOD in `_handlers`, so the bus holds the panel and the panel holds the
bus. Reference counting cannot break a cycle; nothing is freed when the
test's locals go out of scope, and it waits for the cyclic collector,
which runs whenever it likes -- including inside Qt's event dispatch in an
unrelated test. Measured per class: `JobsPanel` (subscribes to nothing)
dies by refcounting, `DockingPanel` needs the cyclic collector,
`PropertyPanel` survives both and is a real leak.

**The fix is `gc.collect()` in a teardown hook, gated on `qapp`.** It
destroys nothing itself -- that distinction is the whole point, since
forcing destruction with `deleteLater()` has now crashed the suite twice
under two different implementations. It only chooses the MOMENT at which
Python does its own ordinary work, and a teardown hook is a moment with no
Qt event dispatch in progress.

| arm | late C++ destructions | full run |
| --- | --- | --- |
| before | 138 | 116 s |
| `gc.collect()` after every test | **0** | 326 s |
| `gc.collect()` only after `qapp` tests | **4** | 171 s |

The last row is what shipped. The four that remain are all inside
`test_quantum_chemistry_panel.py` itself; closing them costs another 155
seconds on every run, which is not worth it for four same-file
destructions when the crash being chased was cross-file.

Corroboration, given how unreliable crash-rate arms are here: the
forced-drain reproduction went **0 crashes in 10** with the fix, and three
plain full runs were green. Neither is proof on its own -- the whole
lesson below is that these arms move between batches -- which is why the
deterministic 138 -> 4 is the number to trust and to re-measure if this
ever comes back.

#### Confirmed again, independently, at the Structure Check work

The reverted fixture's central finding was re-derived from scratch by
somebody who had not yet connected it to this section, which is worth
recording because it means the result is real and not an artefact of how
`dispose_app_widgets` happened to be written.

Adding `tests/test_structure_check_panel.py` (which builds a MainWindow and
pumps events) gave **1 access violation in 5 full runs**, at
`test_a_quick_fix_lands_on_the_undo_stack`. That file inserts ~50 tests
ahead of the panel tests and so shifts collection timing; it does not
introduce anything new. Note `pytest-randomly` IS NOT INSTALLED here, so
file order is deterministic and adding a file is the only thing that
reorders anything.

Seven files build a MainWindow and abandon it -- `test_main_window_*.py`
(six of them) and `test_receptor_library_dialog.py`. Giving each the
per-file disposal recipe from the section above, so the abandoned windows
are destroyed deterministically at teardown, produced:

| arm | forced-drain subset |
| --- | --- |
| abandoned, as today | crash 3/3, then 0/10 on the same tree |
| explicitly disposed | **crash 6/6** |

So **destroying them is worse than leaving them**, which is exactly what
the `dispose_app_widgets` table already said and is now confirmed by a
second, differently-written implementation. Do not try this a third time.

The middle row is the other lesson: an unchanged tree gave 3/3 and then
0/10. The rate itself moves between batches, so **no A/B here is worth
anything below about n=10 per arm**, and a 3-run comparison -- which is
what most of the earlier work in this section used -- can say the opposite
of the truth.

The forced-drain lever from the ketcher section works on this crash too and
is the only reason any of the above could be measured at all:

```python
loop = QEventLoop(); QTimer.singleShot(0, loop.quit); loop.exec()
```

run as an autouse fixture before each test of the victim file.

One caveat worth knowing if you re-run that instrumentation: stacking BOTH
diagnostic plugins on top of the now-permanent fixtures double-wraps every
widget constructor and destabilised a run by itself (a `Fatal Python error:
Aborted` in `test_molstar_viewer_backend.py` that appears under no other
configuration). Run one census at a time.

### The suite must not touch the machine's real settings

`Settings` wraps `QSettings`, which on Windows is the real registry key a
shipped install uses. The autouse `isolated_settings` fixture redirects it to
an INI file under `tmp_path`; `tests/test_settings_isolation.py` fails if that
regresses.

Worth knowing because the previous version of that fixture **looked** correct
and half-worked. It called `QSettings.setDefaultFormat(IniFormat)` and gave
each test a unique org/app name — but `setDefaultFormat` does not affect the
`QSettings(organization, application)` constructor in practice, whatever the
docs say:

```python
QSettings.setDefaultFormat(QSettings.Format.IniFormat)
QSettings.defaultFormat()          # Format.IniFormat
QSettings("Org", "App").format()   # Format.NativeFormat  <- still the registry
```

So the real `OpenChemStudio` key stayed clean (the unique name did that much)
while every run deposited **84 junk keys** under `HKCU\Software`, one per
test, named after the test, permanent. Nothing in the suite output showed it.
Building the QSettings from an explicit file path avoids the format question
entirely.

If you touch that fixture, verify by counting, not by reading:

```bash
powershell "(Get-ChildItem 'HKCU:\Software' | Where-Object PSChildName -like 'OpenChemStudio-pytest-*' | Measure-Object).Count"
```

### `repaint()` does not paint a widget that was never shown

A `paintEvent` test that constructs a widget, resizes it and calls
`repaint()` proves nothing. Measured on a counting subclass:

    repaint() on a never-shown widget    0 paintEvent calls
    update() + processEvents             0
    grab()                               1
    repaint() AFTER show()               1

So `widget.grab()` (or showing it first) is the only way to exercise the
painter. Four such tests existed and were green without ever running the
code they named -- including one called `test_highlighting_survives_a_repaint`,
in which no repaint occurred.

**Use `conftest.painted()` / `conftest.ink()`**, which render into a
`QImage` and force the paint.

ASSERTING THAT SOMETHING WAS DRAWN IS HARDER THAN IT LOOKS, and two
plausible checks were tried and killed by mutation testing -- blanking a
widget's peak-drawing loop and seeing which tests noticed:

1. *"Some pixel is non-transparent."* Useless. Every one of these widgets
   fills an opaque background before its first mark, so alpha is set
   across all 30,000 sampled pixels even for an EMPTY spectrum.
2. *"More ink than the same widget with no data."* Still passes a blanked
   painter. Different data changes the axis range, so the tick labels
   alone move the count.

What works: **hold the axes fixed and vary only the content** -- two
spectra sharing their extreme shifts, differing by one peak in the
middle. Identical ticks and labels, so the ink difference can only be the
peak. That took the number of tests catching a blanked painter from 1
to 6.

`ink()` counts pixels differing from the modal (background) colour, not
transparent ones, for reason 1 above.

Tests that assert on child-widget structure rather than drawing -- e.g.
`test_structure_grid_widget.py` counting cells in a layout -- are not
affected and do not need any of this.

Tests that assert on child-widget structure rather than drawing -- e.g.
`test_structure_grid_widget.py` counting cells in a layout -- are not
affected and do not need this.

### The formerly-flaky webview test

`tests/test_mol3d_viewer_backend.py::test_apply_visualization_sets_atom_colors`
used to fail intermittently on `QWebEngineView` readiness (sometimes a sibling
failed instead — the tell that the test was not what was wrong). It was the
leak above, caught where starting one more Chromium process was slow rather
than impossible.

It failed on the pre-fix baseline run and has passed **5 consecutive full runs**
since. If it flakes again, that is a genuinely new bug, not this one.

### The vendored nomenclature engine's own suite

`tests/vendor/` holds ~3,200 tests belonging to the vendored IUPAC namer. They
are **excluded from the default run** (`norecursedirs` in `pyproject.toml`)
because they take ~10 minutes against the main suite's 3, and they cover that
engine's internals rather than our integration with it.

Run them whenever you change anything under `src/openchem/vendor/`:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME="/d/Random Programs/OpenChemStudio_Data/jre/jdk-21.0.12+8-jre"
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
uv run --no-sync python -u -m pytest tests/vendor -q > /tmp/vendor.log 2>&1; tail -4 /tmp/vendor.log
```

Expect `3209 passed, 0 skipped` (~10 min).

**`JAVA_HOME` AND `PATH`, and they are not the same requirement.** Setting
only PATH gives `3193 passed, 16 skipped` -- which is the figure this file
carried for a long time, then "corrected" to blame an `ImportError` on
`py2opsin`. That attribution was wrong, and measuring it rather than
reasoning about it is what showed the difference:

    py2opsin imports fine, java on PATH   3193 passed, 16 skipped
    JAVA_HOME set as well                 3209 passed, 0 skipped

All 16 live in `tests/vendor/iupac_namer/test_tautomer_alignment.py`, whose
`_java_available()` reads the JAVA_HOME **environment variable** and does not
look at PATH at all. CI sets JAVA_HOME as a side effect of its setup-java
step, which is why CI saw 3209 and a PATH-only local run never could.

Finding them took mapping the `s` characters in pytest's `-q` progress output
back onto `--collect-only` order; `-rs` on the whole suite is another ten
minutes, and the skip reasons are not in a `-q` log.

PATH is still needed on its own: py2opsin shells out to a bare `java`, and
pytest does not inherit the managed Temurin the app injects per-subprocess
(`naming_providers._java_on_path`). Without PATH you get a bare
`FileNotFoundError` naming neither Java nor OPSIN.

## The naming benchmark

`benchmarks/naming/` is the regression check on naming quality — 181 molecules,
scored by OPSIN round-trip rather than string equality. It is the arbiter for
"is this naming engine better", and it has twice overturned a conclusion
reached without it.

Generate fresh predictions, then score them:

```bash
uv run --no-sync python - <<'PY'
import json
from pathlib import Path
from openchem.vendor.iupac_namer import name_smiles
rows = json.loads(Path("benchmarks/naming/corpus.json").read_text(encoding="utf-8"))
preds = []
for r in rows:
    try: preds.append(str(name_smiles(r["smiles"]) or ""))
    except Exception as e: preds.append(f"<ERROR {type(e).__name__}>")
Path("benchmarks/naming/predictions_check.json").write_text(
    json.dumps({"check": {"predictions": preds}}, indent=1), encoding="utf-8")
PY
uv run --no-sync python benchmarks/naming/score.py benchmarks/naming/predictions_check.json
```

Current: **181/181** (82 exact, 98 equivalent, 1 tautomer — metformin, which
counts as a success since the `tautomer` outcome class was added). If a
change under `src/openchem/vendor/` drops this, that
outranks any number of narrow tests it fixed.

`score.py` takes exactly one predictions file. The committed
`predictions_full.json` and `predictions_deterministic.json` were recorded
against the older 124-molecule corpus and will now be **refused** by the
length guard rather than silently mis-scored — that guard is deliberate, not a
bug. They are kept as the record of what the ML alternatives scored at the
time; compare them only against the corpus revision they were made for.

## Ketcher CAN report atom selection, with one trap

The 2D editor was assumed to expose nothing for selection -- its Python
backend has only `load_molblock`, `set_render_option`,
`trigger_toolbar_action` and `get_molblock`. That is a fact about **our
wrapper**, not about Ketcher, and reading the wrapper is what made it look
impossible.

Probing the real vendored build (load `resources/ketcher/dist/index.html`
in a bare `QWebEngineView` and evaluate JS -- far faster than driving the
app) found:

- `ketcher.subscribe(name, handler)` is a **switch** that accepts only
  `'change'` and `'libraryUpdate'`. This is the dead end that makes
  selection look unavailable.
- `editor.subscribe` is a DIFFERENT method and does exist.
- `editor.event` carries ~30 events including **`selectionChange`**, plus
  `click`/`mousedown`/`mousemove` added at runtime by `domEventSetup` --
  so the live object has more than the `this.event = {...}` literal in the
  bundle shows.
- `editor.selection()` reads the current selection synchronously and
  returns `null` when nothing is selected. `editor.selection({atoms:[1]})`
  sets it and dispatches the event, which is how to test this without
  synthesising canvas clicks.

**THE TRAP: `selectionChange` hands your handler `undefined`.** It is a
`PipelineSubscription`, which feeds each handler the PREVIOUS handler's
RETURN VALUE rather than the original payload. Ketcher registers its own
handler first and that one returns nothing, so anything subscribed
afterwards receives `undefined` forever. Measured: a probe handler saw
`typeof sel === 'undefined'` on every dispatch while the event itself was
firing correctly, which reads exactly like "the event does not work".

`change` does NOT behave this way -- it is a plain `Subscription` -- so the
two look interchangeable and are not.

The fix is one line: ignore the argument and call
`ketcherInstance.editor.selection()` inside the handler.

Editing `tools/ketcher-host/src/main.jsx` requires `npm run build` in that
directory for anything to change; `resources/ketcher/dist/` is build
output. node and npm are installed, and a build takes about 25 seconds.

## Verification standard

This project's convention, established across many sessions: **claims are
measured, not asserted.** Before shipping a formula, a threshold, a parser
regex or a model, verify it against a primary source or a real run and record
what was checked. Several things were deliberately NOT shipped because they
could not be validated (Miller polarizability, HLB, TSEI) — that is a normal
outcome here, not a failure.

Comments explain **why**, especially where something is non-obvious or was got
wrong once. A comment restating the code is noise.

### Koopmans hardness is wrong for the pair people actually use it on

Recorded here rather than only in `chem/conceptual_dft.py` because the trap is
general: an approximation that reproduces the first case you try is not
validated, and the second case is where it breaks.

Measured on real ORCA 6.1.1 B3LYP/def2-SVP runs of both textbook hard/soft
pairs:

| η (eV) | Koopmans | ΔSCF |
| --- | --- | --- |
| water | 4.57 | 8.06 |
| hydrogen sulfide | 3.90 | 6.93 |
| ammonia | 4.16 | 7.21 |
| phosphine | 4.27 | **7.02** |

Koopmans gets water/hydrogen sulfide right and **inverts ammonia against
phosphine**, making phosphine the harder — when hard nitrogen against soft
phosphorus is one of the most-used orderings in coordination chemistry. Every
molecule here has a NEGATIVE electron affinity, so its "LUMO" is an unbound
state belonging to the basis set rather than the molecule, and Koopmans reads
that number straight out.

Both ship. Koopmans is genuinely free from any job that has already run and
carries a caveat naming this failure on every descriptor;
`test_koopmans_inverts_ammonia_against_phosphine` asserts the inversion **on
purpose**, so if a future method stops inverting it the test fails and the
caveat can come off.

**ORCA compound jobs (`$new_job`) run all three ΔSCF calculations in one
input**, confirmed live — so this needed no notion of chained runs in the
service. The three `FINAL SINGLE POINT ENERGY` lines are told apart only by
POSITION, which is why `test_the_three_delta_scf_blocks_are_written_in_parser_order`
exists: swapping the cation and anion blocks flips the sign of both I and A,
still produces plausible numbers, and survived every other test in the file.

### ORCA's LED summary block does not mean what it looks like it means

Recorded because a plan written without running it specified parsing the
wrong block, and the wrong numbers are plausible rather than absurd.

**`FINAL SUMMARY DLPNO-CCSD ENERGY DECOMPOSITION` is not an interaction
decomposition.** Its correlation lines split the complex's TOTAL
correlation energy into dispersive and non-dispersive parts, intra-fragment
correlation included. Verified by arithmetic against the same output, exact
to the last digit:

    Non dispersion (strong pairs)  =  intra strong pairs
                                    + (inter strong - dispersion strong)
                                    + singles
    -0.414932699                   =  -0.394372938 - 0.020556328 - 0.000003433

So that line reads **-260 kcal/mol** where the real non-dispersive
interaction is **-12.9**. Only the REF lines are what they appear to be:
`Electrostatics (REF.) + Exchange (REF.)` does equal the inter-fragment
reference interaction exactly.

**And `Total interaction` is not a binding energy** -- ORCA reports
**-428 kcal/mol** for BH3-CO, whose bond enthalpy is near -25. A
single-point LED partitions the complex's own energy, so the inter-fragment
part carries all the nuclear-electron attraction between fragments. A
binding energy needs the ISOLATED fragments, which is why `chem/orca_led.py`
writes three jobs.

With those, it reconciles: the six terms sum to -36.58 kcal/mol against a
supermolecular -36.62. **The 0.05 residual is nameable, not slop** -- it is
exactly the gap between the LED's own total and `FINAL SINGLE POINT ENERGY`,
i.e. how DLPNO splits the (T) correction. It is reported rather than hidden.

**`$new_job` does NOT generalise from delta-SCF.** Inside a compound job
ORCA restarts from the previous job's orbitals, which is valid for
delta-SCF (same geometry, different charges) and fatal here, because a
fragment has fewer atoms:

    Error: Input geometry does not match current geometry
    ORCA finished by error termination in GUESS       -- exit 55, 1 energy of 3

`PModel` on the fragment blocks fixes it. **`NOAUTOSTART` looks like the fix
and is not** -- it governs picking up a `.gbw` left on disk, not the restart
from the preceding block, and the run failed identically with it in place.

Two measurement traps from the cost estimate, both paid for once:

- **Residual disk is not peak disk, by a factor of 575.** benzene-water
  leaves 3.3 MB behind and used **1899 MB while running**. The first
  estimator was anchored on residual and under-predicted the thing that
  fills a drive by three orders of magnitude. Sample during the run.
- **The textbook cc-pVDZ contraction is wrong for this job.** 14 per
  first-row atom predicts 57 functions for BH3-CO; ORCA reports 75. Solving
  the two measured totals gives 20 and 5, confirmed against a third job it
  was not fitted to (BH3 alone: predicted 35, reported 35).

Measured anchors, same sampling harness: BH3-CO 6 atoms/75 functions, 15 s,
102 MB peak; benzene-water 15 atoms/180 functions, 595 s, 1899 MB peak.
Two points determine a power law exactly and cannot validate it, so the
estimator is a guide for "minutes vs hours vs do not start it".

One more thing this work paid for, and it was a GUARD that found it rather
than review: `tests/test_layering.py` forbids a `ui/` module importing
RDKit, and the pre-launch cost dialog did exactly that to count fragments
with `Chem.GetMolFrags`. It reads as obviously fine in isolation, which is
the point -- the count now comes from `estimate_led_cost_for` in the chem
layer and the UI imports nothing chemical.

### An engine and its own data table have to be run against each other

The Lewis adduct work shipped a Drago-Wayland parameter table and an
acceptor-detection engine that were each individually tested and green.
Run together, **the engine refused 14 of the 24 acids in its own table** --
every alcohol and phenol, pyrrole, chloroform. Nothing but running the two
against each other revealed it, and the fix was three new acceptor rules,
not a tweak.

Iodine and benzene were among the refused, and both are pairs in the
table's *own validation set* — so the engine could not reproduce the data
that justified shipping the table.

`test_every_acid_in_the_shipped_table_passes_the_acceptor_gate` is the
guard. Any future data table should get the equivalent.

The most useful of the three rules is worth knowing on its own: **a
hydrogen bond and a halogen bond are the same mechanism**, donation into
the sigma* of a polarised single bond, differing only in the heavy atom.
They share `LOW_LYING_SIGMA_STAR` because that is accurate, not
convenient. A consequence: alcohols and amines come out AMBIPHILIC, since
the oxygen donates its lone pairs while its O-H accepts. Water is the
textbook case, and several tests had to be updated to say `ambiphilic`
where they had said `donor` — the behaviour change was correct.

### The two orbital measures disagree on the motivating case

Measured on real ORCA delta-SCF runs of the pair the whole feature exists
for:

| | frontier gap | HSAB \|Δη\| |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BH₃ + CO | **8.13 eV** | 1.63 eV |
| BF₃ + CO | 10.90 eV | **0.89 eV** |

Borane binds CO strongly enough to isolate the adduct; BF₃ barely binds it.
The frontier gap says so. **The |Δη| proxy says the opposite**, because
CO's computed hardness (8.40) lands near BF₃'s (9.29) rather than
reflecting the softness the qualitative argument gives it — a single
number on the η scale is not Pearson's classification.

This is reported, not resolved, and it is the strongest justification for
the no-combined-score design: an average would have split the difference
on a case where one line is simply right.
`test_the_two_orbital_lines_disagree_on_carbon_monoxide` asserts it on
purpose.

Two measurement traps from the same work, both already paid for once:

- **A fixture labelled "verbatim from a real run" had energies typed from
  memory.** The assertions used `abs=0.01` tolerances, which were loose enough
  to hide it — so the arithmetic was being checked against itself rather than
  against the run. Copy the numbers, and assert tightly enough that a wrong
  fixture cannot pass.
- **`X = '' or (...)` mutates nothing**, since the empty string is falsy and
  the original is returned. Two mutations written that way reported a
  confident SURVIVED for changes never applied. A mutation script must verify
  its edit changed behaviour, not merely that the pattern matched.
- **A restored file can still run as the MUTATED one, from stale bytecode.**
  Python validates a `.pyc` against the source's mtime and size, both of
  which a write-mutate-restore cycle can leave unchanged within one mtime
  tick. Seen live: a restored `chem/lewis.py` read `0` on disk and in
  `inspect.getsource`, while the imported module held the mutated `1` — the
  test "failed after restore" and the source was innocent. Any mutation
  script should `rm -rf` the `__pycache__` directories between arms, or run
  with `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`, and a surprising post-restore result
  should be re-checked with the cache cleared before it is believed.
- **A surviving mutation found a real sign error nobody would have read.**
  The Drago W term is ADDED (`−ΔH = E_A·E_B + C_A·C_B + W`) and was written
  subtracted. Every test passed, because every acid the tests touch has
  `W = 0` — only two entries in the whole table have one. Coverage of a
  parameter's *common* value is not coverage of the parameter.

### Alex has the paywalled papers. Ask before hedging around one.

Three primary sources that this work had been treating as unobtainable are
on disk at `D:\Xaero Stuff\Documents\Sci Downloads\`: Drago & Wayland 1965,
Parr & Pearson 1983, and Pearson 1988. **Reading them changed real claims**,
so when a source is needed, ask rather than write "paywalled, orderings
pinned instead".

There is no PDF text extractor in the project venv and `pdftoppm` is not
installed, so `Read` on a PDF fails. `uv pip install --system pymupdf` and
`fitz` works.

What the papers changed:

- **The 1965 E/C parameters are on a DIFFERENT SCALE from the shipped ones**
  and must not be mixed. That paper normalises iodine to E_A = C_A = 1.000
  ("relative to E_A and C_A of iodine being 1"); the modern compilation puts
  iodine at 0.50 and 2.0. Its *observed enthalpies* are scale-free, and are
  now a second, independent validation set — 12 values across three acid
  series.
- **The model's best test is one it fails.** The paper measures F-strain in
  trimethylborane's amine adducts: 8.2 kcal/mol for trimethylamine, 1.5 for
  dimethylamine, nothing for the two smaller ones. An E/C equation has no
  steric term, so it *must* over-predict exactly those two — and does, by
  6.1 and 1.1. A table that fitted all four would mean the parameters had
  absorbed a steric effect they are not supposed to contain.
- **Every hardness value quoted from memory was right**, and none of them
  should have been quoted from memory. η(H₂O)=9.5, η(NH₃)=8.2, η(H₂S)=6.2,
  η(PH₃)=6.0, all confirmed in Pearson 1988 Table II. They are asserted now.
- **A claim in this file's own tests was wrong.** ΔSCF's electron-affinity
  error is NOT one-directional. ΔSCF returns −3.6 to −3.8 eV for all four
  molecules, whose true affinities span −1.9 to −6.4: the unbound anion
  barely knows which molecule it is on. That *compresses* the hardness
  scale, and the NH₃/PH₃ ordering it gets right survives by **0.19 eV**
  where experiment separates them by 2.2. The ordering is correct; the
  margin is not something to lean on.
- **Pearson's own rows round to ±0.1** — H₂S's (I−A)/2 gives 6.3 against a
  printed η of 6.2 — so a self-consistency check on transcription needs
  `abs=0.15`, not `0.05`.

Gutmann donor/acceptor numbers were assessed and **not shipped**. The
accessible source (Frontiers in Chemistry 2022, 10.3389/fchem.2022.861379)
tabulates ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents rather than the classical
molecular table, and reports its own acceptor-number model failing outright
("no correlation could be found"), concluding it supports "qualitative and
relative criteria but not an absolute and quantitative model". Note the
donor number is *defined* as −ΔH against SbCl₅, which is already in the
Drago table — so that line is partly available already.
